Bob Riley convened a task force of representatives from public and private institutions across the state to create the blueprints for the Alabama Connecting Classrooms, Educators, & Students Statewide (ACCESS) Distance Learning Program, with the mission to equalize education opportunities across the state. At the time, nearly 32 percent of Alabama public school students were enrolled in rural schools. The year prior, the state administered only 99 Advanced Placement (AP) exams per 1,000 juniors and seniors, which ranked Alabama as 14th out of the 16 southern states in availability of AP courses to high school students.The task force agreed to a basic plan to bring a wide variety of AP, foreign language, dual-credit, core, and elective courses to Alabama’s high school students—and several courses eventually to middle school students as well—through the development of a statewide videoconferencing and online learning program. The task force assigned the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE) to launch and operate the initiative. Among other administrative responsibilities, ALSDE was in charge of securing statewide licenses for software and managing content acquisition and development.In its initial budget, the task force made provision for upgrading hardware, particularly desktop workstations, to allow students to access online courses. It planned to award every high school with up to $85,000 to add a “21st Century Classroom” that included videoconference equipment, at least 25 tablet PCs, wireless connectivity, interactive white boards, projectors, and scanners. Pursuant to this plan, the program office secured licenses with Elluminate, which it later replaced with WebEx, for Internet conferencing.The task force also worked with the Alabama Supercomputer Authority to upgrade and extend the Alabama Research and Education Network (AREN), which brought Internet infrastructure to the state’s government, schools, and libraries. ACCESS’s ambition was for all schools and district offices to enjoy 10 megabits per second (Mbps) of connectivity by building out the AREN architecture.In early 2006 the program office issued a proposal request to find partners to operate three support centers. The support centers would run the technical help desk; hire, train, and evaluate teachers; and advocate and plan for the future growth of ACCESS. Madison City Schools, Troy University, and The University of Alabama, College of Continuing Studies won the bids and became the three regional centers.Blended model  ACCESS facilitates blended learning by delivering Web-based instruction (WBI), or online learning, to high school and middle school students across the state. In essence, students take the majority of their classes through their traditional brick-and-mortar schools and classrooms and one or more online classes through ACCESS, either remotely or on campus in a “21st Century Classroom.”In many cases ACCESS uses interactive videoconferencing to provide synchronous communication experiences between the teacher and up to three classrooms of remote students. (ACCESS also delivers purely videoconference-based courses, although those do not fall within the scope of this study because they do not involve online learning.) For the WBI courses, students access coursework online. The software delivers content in various ways, including via text, graphics, audio, video, drills, an online teacher, games, assessments, and physical materials or labs. Students submit work to online teachers via a virtual dropbox, and the teacher responds later with feedback and guidance. Under program rules, all ACCESS teachers have to be Alabama certified and meet federal standards for “highly qualified.” Because the online delivery method in Alabama is mostly asynchronous, online teachers can teach in traditional classrooms during the day and then manage an online course from their homes at night. Indeed, most members of the ACCESS teaching staff have regular teaching jobs during the day. ACCESS officials said that at first they had to recruit teachers to sign on, but that over time a wait list formed. ACCESS pays its online teachers $150 per student per half-credit.ACCESS’s support centers had recruited and trained a total of 659 ACCESS teachers by the end of 2010. Professional development followed the Southern Regional Education Board’s “Guidelines for Professional Development of Online Teachers.” ACCESS also offered professional development for superintendents, technology coordinators, counselors, and principals.ACCESS purchased perpetual licenses for 32 courses from Florida Virtual School and 13 from Aventa Learning. It also created 20 of its own courses, as well as five noncredit remediation modules to prepare students for the Alabama High School Graduation Exam.ALSDE’s ACCESS office also awarded 360 grants, ranging from $50,000 to $85,000, to equip each Alabama public high school with a “21st Century Classroom.” As mentioned earlier, the team licensed Elluminate, which it later replaced with WebEx, for Internet conferencing.The Alabama Supercomputer Authority worked with ACCESS to extend the high-speed AREN data network to the K–12 system. By the end of 2010 it had delivered broadband connectivity, at a minimum of 20 Mbps, to all 371 high schools and 133 central district offices and had begun to upgrade to 50 Mbps. It also organized a consortium of school districts to apply jointly for E-Rate funding to streamline the application process.The Alabama legislature funded ACCESS as a line item in the state budget. This funding model meant that ACCESS did not compete with districts for per-pupil funds, which greatly enhanced its appearance to districts as an opportunity, rather than a threat. From the start of the program to the fall of 2010, the lump-sum funding had been adequate to accommodate students’ demand for ACCESS courses without necessitating a wait list. Total funding from 2008 to 2011 hovered around $20 million per year.Notable results  By the end of 2010, ACCESS was the third-largest state virtual school in the country, with 29,415 enrollments and 11,746 non-credit enrollments in 2010. ACCESS’s enrollment growth rate declined in 2010 relative to that of other state virtual schools, largely because of ACCESS’s focus on deploying technology infrastructure in 2010 rather than on increasing enrollments.Alabama’s K–12 education system claimed several successes during the span of ACCESS’s existence. The number of AP test takers in Alabama public schools almost doubled from 2004 to 2010; the number of African American AP test takers more than quadrupled; and the number of qualifying exam scores more than doubled. Between 2002 and 2008, Alabama’s high school graduation rate climbed from 62.1 to 69.0 percent, a gain that was 4.3 percentage points above the national average for that time period. Although other factors may have contributed to these improvements, ACCESS was the driving force in bringing advanced coursework and alternative education options to Alabama.On the horizon  Alabama made the Advanced Academic Endorsement Diploma the default diploma for the class of 2013. This diploma required the completion of at least 20 hours of an online course or experience. The state also removed the seat-time requirement to allow for credit recovery and credit advancement based on demonstrating competency rather than on completing a certain number of hours of coursework. This paved the way for more innovative scheduling options for schools. ACCESS piloted two credit-recovery courses in the spring of 2010.ACCESS intends to focus on bringing digital resources into traditional classrooms in the years ahead. It especially wants to find ways to help face-to-face teachers use the learning management system and ACCESS’s other resources as sustaining technologies in their face-to-face classrooms.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Students choose from a menu of online and other options for learning. Many students use online programs for certain subjects, with a face-to-face teacher providing as-needed help.Program backgroundHistory and context  Jeff and Laura Sandefer wanted more for their children than “to be talked at all day long for eight hours a day” in a traditional classroom with a single teacher delivering monolithic instruction. As the founder of the nationally acclaimed Acton School of Business and a graduate-level teacher for over 21 years, Jeff Sandefer had extensive experience in both the education sector and in launching startups. Laura Sandefer had earned a Master of Education at Vanderbilt University.The Sandefers’ desire to ensure that their children would experience top-quality educations inspired them to found a private school that would use the best of face-to-face instruction, project-based learning, and online-learning tools. They named it the Acton Academy, after Lord John Emerich Edward Dahlberg Acton (1834–1902), a Victorian political philosopher.The Acton Academy’s mission is “to inspire each child and parent who enters [its] doors to find a calling that will change the world.” The theme underscoring its curriculum is heroes and callings. The school promises that students will embark on a hero’s journey to discover the unique contributions that they can make to live a life of meaning and purpose. The Sandefers believe this narrative motivates the children to learn and find the courage to push past setbacks. The school’s curriculum also focuses on developing character, fostering an appreciation for liberty, and stoking students’ curiosity.The Acton Academy opened in 2009 with 11 to 12 students, which meant that for group project time, students divided into two groups of six. It now has 16 students, which divide into four groups of four. According to the Austin Business Journal, the Acton Academy is one of about 25 independent schools in central Texas. Tuitions at these schools range from $2,800 a year per student to $17,750 a year. The Acton Academy charges $850 a month, or $9,350 a year.Blended model  Upon scaling fully, the school will have one master teacher who serves 36 students with the help of two assistants. These assistants could potentially be high school students who work for free in exchange for high school credit. In the Acton model, rather than lecturing to such a large group, the master teacher relies on Socratic discussions and small-group experiences. She divides the students into groups with a mix of grade levels and abilities. In the groups, the students discuss and learn together while the teacher supervises, but does not lead. “Students can lead themselves,” Jeff Sandefer said. “They can self-organize pretty quickly.”The Acton Academy follows a year-round schedule with a short summer break and more frequent weeklong breaks throughout the year to allow families to travel together. The typical daily schedule is as follows:8 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. Arrival 8:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. Morning Group 9 am. to 11 a.m. Individual Work 11 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Free outdoor play (3x per week) 11:30 a.m. to noon World History (3x per week) 11 a.m. to noon P.E. (2x per week) Noon to 1 p.m. Lunch and personal time 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. Art (2x per week) or Writing Workshop (3x per week) 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. Group Work/Lessons 3 p.m. to 3:15 p.m. Closing GroupDuring the individual work portion of the day, students spend in-depth time concentrating on core subjects. Each student progresses along her own path, which the teacher monitors on a weekly chart. Students have the option of using online programs to learn material or to use other approaches, such as Montessori-style manipulatives, worksheets, physical textbooks, and so forth. The face-to-face teachers provide individual support as needed for the students as they progress at their own pace and along their own path.Many students opt for an online platform to deliver some or all of their core instruction. Rosetta Stone, DreamBox Math, and Learning Today for reading are the most popular programs.In addition, all students learn about entrepreneurship and business finance using a series of six online simulations that Jeff Sandefer created originally for the Acton School of Business. These interactive games, called Acton Sims, are available at www.actontoolkit.org.The Acton Academy uses project-based experiences to expand upon and give context to the foundational lessons. Among the school’s most distinctive programs is its hosting of the Children’s Business Fair (www.childrensbusinessfair.org), an annual event in Austin in which children ages 5 to 13 sell goods and services of their own making to the public. In 2010 the event featured 81 booths; over 700 shoppers attended.Students use various software programs to support their team projects. In a module about robots, electricity, and computer programming, for example, students used LEGO Mindstorms, Lightbot, Lego the Turtle, Scratch, and Alice.Students are accountable for their learning in four ways. First, they must pass the short-cycle assessments that accompany their chosen programs to progress to the next level. For example, a student using DreamBox to learn math must pass the unit tests that DreamBox’s LMS delivers before moving on. Second, Acton Academy provides parents with a list of grade-specific standards and then sends home portfolios of the students’ work. Parents are responsible for checking student progress against these standards and monitoring results. Third, students must understand key skills to be successful in group projects. They are accountable to their peers, and this team-based approach motivates students to master their fundamentals. Finally, students take the SAT10 standardized test once a year to ensure comprehensive progress.Notable results  On average, the Acton Academy’s first group of students gained about 2.5 grade levels in the first ten months.  Because they were already about one grade level above their age cohort when they entered, most are 3.5 grade levels above their age-group now.Another feature of the Acton Academy is that students complete a survey every week on SurveyMonkey, and teacher bonuses are tied to their satisfaction. Teachers do not assess students in the traditional sense and are forbidden from telling parents how the children are performing. Instead, as discussed, students create portfolios of their work, and parents review their child’s progress by comparing the portfolios to the grade-level standards.On the horizon  Next year the Acton Academy will expand to include middle-school students. The Sandefers plan to build out the program to accommodate 36 elementary, 36 middle, and 36 high school students over the next several years. The middle school (serving grades 6–9) will open in the fall of 2012.The Sandefers are developing a series of kits that include materials, curricula, and documents to facilitate the replication of other schools like theirs outside of Austin. They view the Acton Academy as a lab where they can experiment with curriculum and design until they arrive at the right model for other entrepreneurs to follow. The Sandefers need to recoup $100,000 to break even on their investment in the school, but they expect that future schools that use their kits will have start-up costs around $30,000. The Sandefers intend for the economics of the Acton Academy to offer an attractive value proposition for other entrepreneurs.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

For years he sold Plato to districts as a remediation and recovery program for at-risk students. Murray also spent 10 years on the Board of the National Dropout Prevention Network (NDPN). He was troubled, however, that the nation’s dropout rate had scarcely improved after 30 years of efforts by these and other organizations to reduce the number of students who leave school before graduating.Murray developed a new model that would allow him to deliver dropout-recovery programming directly to students, rather than leaving the program for districts to execute themselves. A believer in public education, Murray wanted to work within the system and find a sustainable, scalable solution, so he developed a school-within-a-school model and created AdvancePath Academics.Blended model  AdvancePath Academics is a for-profit service provider that partners with districts to educate and graduate their dropout and at-risk high school population. To sell the vision to districts, Murray begins by showing them their data and pointing to the growing number of non-traditional children for whom he contends the block schedule is not an ideal fit. Murray believes that serving these students is outside the core competency and teaching culture of most traditional districts. He asks districts to give AdvancePath Academics about 3,000 square feet within one of their school facilities to set up an AdvancePath Academy. Each AdvancePath Academy divides into four zones: (1) a parent and visitor reception area; (2) a technology computer lab with a 1-to-1 computer-to-student ratio; (3) an offline reading and writing zone; and (4) an area for small-group instruction with teachers. The intention is for this professional-feeling environment to foster a climate of respect and studiousness among the students, as well as a culture of team teaching and learning. The underlying philosophy at AdvancePath Academics is that all students are respected as individuals and supported in their endeavors.Students attend the AdvancePath Academy five days per week and choose to attend the morning, afternoon, or evening session. Each session lasts four hours. The staff often open the AdvancePath Academy on Saturdays for make-up days and throughout the summer. When students first enroll, the AdvancePath Academy tests them and creates an individualized learning plan (ILP) for each student. The ILPs paint a map for the students of how much work they need to do to graduate. Students learn to think in terms of “My GIG” (My Goal is Graduation). AdvancePath Academies offer students flexibility to choose what they accomplish each day.Each AdvancePath Academy is staffed with five to seven adults. One adult works as a full-time registrar, one as a community liaison to recover and retain youth, one as an aide, and the rest as face-to-face teachers. Most courses do not include online teachers. AdvancePath Academics uses Apex Learning for its core curriculum and American Education A+ for non-core curriculum and electives. It uses EDmin for the learning management system, but it has customized EDmin extensively to create the data systems it needs to inform lesson planning.The company evaluates each district’s total public revenue, staff costs, and current expenditures on district alternative programs, and then calculates a per-student daily rate. AdvancePath Academics only charges for days that students attend; if a student does not show up, the district does not pay. The average daily rate across the country is approximately $40 per student.Students can graduate from an AdvancePath Academy with a state-recognized high school diploma from their district, as opposed to a GED.Notable results  Most students enter an AdvancePath Academy one-and-a-half to two years behind academically. Murray has found that students do not need face-to-face reading intervention as much as he had anticipated; rather, the online work mixed with independent reading helps most students catch up within a year. As of the spring of 2010, AdvancePath Academics has graduated 1,350 students and is on track to graduate another 1,250 in the 2010–11 school year. About 50 percent of graduates have gone on to post-secondary schooling. A precise success metric is difficult to gauge because of the transient population, but Murray says that the company is successful with nine out of 10 students, many of whom have failed consistently over many years—and that its students often achieve a 200 to 300 percent gain versus their pre-enrollment index, an internal measure of a student’s level, in 10 months.On the horizon  To date, California has 12 AdvancePath Academies, Maryland has two, Michigan five, Alaska three, and Washington, DC has one. AdvancePath Academics expects to open several new AdvancePath Academies in 2011 in its current states as well as in two to three new states. The company says it can launch an AdvancePath Academy from the ground up in two to three weeks, although six weeks is preferred. “We have built a very automated process,” Murray said.Murray expects that to expand capacity in the future, his business will offer a virtual high school for the same population of students. He notes that this would especially help the roughly 6 percent of students who get expelled from the AdvancePath Academies each year. Virtual students will attend a brick-and-mortar school for a limited time to meet their specific needs and do the rest remotely to free up space for other students.Murray also sees an opportunity for an AdvancePath Academy-in-a-box solution to bring the AdvancePath system to small and rural districts that cannot afford the traditional service.Finally, Murray is optimistic about the opportunity for special education students. Currently, each AdvancePath Academy allows for 20 to 25 percent of its students to be special education students at no extra charge unless the number of those students exceeds the 20 to 25 percent threshold. Murray points out that this often presents a huge cost savings for districts.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Alliance currently manages 12 high schools and six middle schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Its model has always relied on providing access to technology for disadvantaged children, so the decision to experiment with blended learning aligned well with the organization’s philosophy.Alliance has piloted two separate forays into blended learning. In the summer of 2010, out of budget necessity, Alliance was forced to convert the summer program at one of its schools to purely online delivery at the school’s computer labs. Separately, in the fall of 2010 Alliance began to pilot a new blended program for ninth graders in two of its high schools: Alliance College-Ready Academy High School #11 and Heritage College-Ready Academy High School.Blended model  For the summer program, the participating high school employed a principal, assistant principal, counselor, and only one certificated teacher. Most students attended the physical campus to take the courses, although they had the option to take the courses at home if they had connectivity. The courses were mostly online textbooks, with little provision for student interaction other than reading the texts and completing assessments. Students used this opportunity for credit recovery or to get ahead.Alliance’s more central project to experiment with blended learning began in the fall of 2010 with the launch of a pilot study at two of its high schools. The blended-learning model at these schools involved extending most class periods to 120 minutes. Within each class period, the students learned online for 50 to 75 percent of the time, with the exception of English and physical education, where online learning constituted 30 to 50 percent of the time. Teachers divided their classes into three student groups that cycled through a learning circle, including: (1) individualized online instruction using adaptive content; (2) focused teacher-led instruction based on data from online-content systems to set the level for each group; and (3) learning stations with structured, collaborative, standards-based activities.The “best-of-both-worlds” theory behind this blended model combined individualized online instruction with focused, teacher-led, small-group instruction. The intent was to free up resources and reallocate them to need-specific services, as well as to improve college readiness by engaging students with technology, mixed with group participation and reflection.Class sizes remained unchanged during the pilot, although theoretically the online component could eventually free up teacher resources enough to accommodate larger class sizes. The pilot focused on training teachers and assessing results to ensure that the model worked before making further changes to class design or structure. One of the explicit long-term objectives of the program, however, was to leverage instructional technologies effectively and efficiently to increase the number of students that Alliance could serve and to reallocate labor cost savings to programs which would increase student achievement.Other goals included providing differentiated instruction customized to student needs, an evolving pedagogy that moved teachers beyond the lecturer role, more engaging learning sessions for students, and a rethinking of how to integrate technology into the classroom to make learning more effective and efficient.In the pilot-study model, the reconfigured role of teachers allowed them to update each student’s personalized learning plan regularly, instead of only at the beginning of the year. Online instruction allowed students to self-pace, instead of being tethered to the clock. The goal was to make the curriculum more engaging and intrinsically motivating than in a traditional lecture-style classroom.Alliance planned to collect, analyze, and use data to inform individualized learning plans throughout the year. Assessments measured student proficiency at the end of each six-to-eight week instruction period. The pilot schools uploaded assessment results into DataDirector, and then teachers accessed these results to provide customized interventions. The student data management systems—PowerSchool for some of Alliance’s schools and Global Scholar’s Excelsior Pinnacle for the others—tracked ongoing performance to monitor classroom success. These systems also served as the parent communication portals. They were also used to manage each student’s personal learning plans. Alliance did not yet have an integrated platform that linked student data, teacher data, attendance data, standards, and the like. It is working with Education Elements to create such a platform.Notable results  The pilot testing was too premature to produce results, but the model did promise various cost savings. Initially, the main savings came from replacing textbooks with free eBooks. Alliance was spending $50,000 on average per grade level on textbooks, but the new model eliminated these costs. The blended model could eventually free up teacher resources to allow for larger class sizes and a rethinking of facility costs. The purpose of the pilot study, however, was to test the efficacy of blended learning and analyze student engagement and staff readiness, rather than to realize savings.The summer school program dramatically reduced labor costs, thereby producing trem-endous cost savings relative to the prior year. In the past, Alliance had paid for roughly 15 full-time teachers for four weeks at their regular compensation rate for one month at a cost of $75,000 for labor. The virtual summer school only needed a principal, assistant principal, counselor, and one teacher at a total cost of $33,000—less than half the cost of prior years. It also saved expenses on hardcopy supplemental summer session instructional material, which usually were around $60 per student.On the horizon  Alliance plans to implement a newly designed whole school model, called BLAST, in the fall of 2011 for grades 9 to 12. Building upon the results of the 2010–11 pilot study, BLAST will be the first of many schools that Alliance plans to open in the future with a schoolwide blended-learning backbone. In contrast to the schools in the pilot study, BLAST will use higher student-to-teacher ratios to help reduce costs.Alliance has joined four other CMOs to form the nonprofit, College Ready Promise, which received a $60 million operating grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. College Ready Promise will use $22 million of this grant to build a better data warehouse system that will measure teacher effectiveness by linking student achievement data with teacher and classroom performance. Alliance plans to develop rubrics to measure teacher effectiveness in a blended-learning environment as part of this project.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Their first school, the Metropolitan Regional Career and Technical Center (the “Met”), opened in 1996 in Rhode Island with a class of 50 mostly at-risk African American and Latino students. By 2008, over 60 Big Picture schools were operating in 14 states with strong financial backing from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation—and several were operating internationally. Big Picture schools all opened under the same set of distinguishing principles, including promoting learning in the real world, individualizing learning plans for each student, engaging parents and families, preparing for college and professions, and using authentic, portfolio-based assessment to demonstrate genuine competency.Today, Big Picture describes its learning method as follows: The Advisor works with the 15-member class to find what interests and motivates each student. The Mentor—a lawyer, engineer, merchant, or other professional—guides each student’s internship. The Parent is actively enrolled as a resource to the Big Picture Learning community. The Student interacts along with her fellow students to reinforce each other’s passion for real work in the real world. The result is a self-teaching community of learners where no one feels left out, and each helps motivate the other.Blended model  At Big Picture schools, the advisor, parent, student, and, ideally, mentor sit down together to agree to a customized learning plan for the student, driven by the student’s personal interests and needs. The team decides on a set of curricula that best meets these needs, with an emphasis on helping the student do real work in the real world. Washor explains that sometimes this team may decide to deploy an online-learning modality to satisfy elements of the learning plan. Big Picture does not contract with specific online-learning providers or espouse a particular online approach. Rather, individual Big Picture schools have the option of using online learning on their own if they see that it meets an individual learner’s “just-in-time” education needs.Students are responsible for creating their own schedules and being resourceful about finding the tools they need to accomplish the elements of their learning plans. In some cases students might use an online simulation technology, such as a virtual reality welding simulator to learn how to weld at a fraction of the cost (and burns) of real-life welding. When students need help with a topic, they might use an online tutorial or connect over email with their mentors. Students own their performance on state assessment tests, and in some cases they turn to an online course to prepare them.Thus, Big Picture represents a unique, but important example along the spectrum of blended-learning approaches. It neither embraces a specific set of content providers nor standardizes on a single learning management system. The idea of a software-based learning management system runs counter to Big Picture’s emphasis on advisors, parents, mentors, and students managing learning through frequent, live, face-to-face meetings. Online programming is very much a part of the menu for Big Picture students, but its use is highly varied and individualized across Big Picture’s 9,000 students. Collective data describing which students are using what is not available at the time of this writing.Notable results  Big Picture reports that on average, 90 percent of its students graduate on time, 85 percent of graduates are accepted to college, and overall, Big Picture high school students outperform their comparable peers in traditional public schools on state achievement tests. Recent data comparing graduation rates, college acceptance rate, and achievement-test results for students at Big Picture schools versus their counterparts in Detroit, Los Angeles, San Diego, Providence, and Oakland, indicate that Big Picture students in these cities often outperform their peers.On the horizon  Big Picture reports that on average, 90 percent of its students graduate on time, 85 percent of graduates are accepted to college, and overall, Big Picture high school students outperform their comparable peers in traditional public schools on state achievement tests.

The department released iZone schools from some regulations and provided them with resources and support to experiment with new models. Brownsville Academy High School (Brownsville), located in east Brooklyn, NY, was one such school.The leadership team at Brownsville decided to use the Diploma Plus program for its model. Diploma Plus is a national nonprofit that has partnered with 28 alternative high schools across the United States to help students who are at least two years behind get back on track. Its central office is in Boston and it has five regional networks. Its model revolves around four essentials: (1) a performance-based system; (2) a supportive school culture; (3) a future focus; and (4) effective supports.In keeping with its performance-based philosophy, Diploma Plus emphasizes student progress against a set of core competencies aligned with Common Core State Standards. This competency-based approach relies on extensive short-cycle assessments to understand how students are progressing on a daily and weekly basis against the learning objectives. A few years ago, Diploma Plus’s leaders decided to invest in a technical solution to manage that large quantity of assessment data. The leaders hired Matt Mervis as a consultant to build a proprietary learning management system, DPNet. As DPNet progressed, Diploma Plus realized that it could also use it to extend how and when students learned. This new application of DPNet facilitated the transition to blended learning in many Diploma Plus schools.Blended model  Students at Brownsville take classes in 90-minute blocks, with 12 to 17 students per classroom. Browsville’s classrooms run on a “workshop” system, which means that a face-to-face teacher rotates the students through some direct instruction, some DPNet-based curriculum, and some commercial online courseware. Usually class begins with the teacher doing an initiation into the content, then assigning a task, and then dividing the class into the divergent tracks. The teacher’s job is complicated because she has to manage both the face-to-face and online modalities simultaneously each class period.Brownsville Academy teachers are creating much of their own content to allow them to customize their methodologies. Many teachers feel that the bulk of online content has too much of an emphasis on reading text and then taking multiple-choice assessments, an approach that contradicts Diploma Plus’s philosophy of students demonstrating authentic mastery of material.DPNet plays a central role in Brownsville’s delivery system. Brownsville teachers use DPNet to connect with other teachers via the online teacher’s lounge. The learning management system also includes an assessment engine, which measures student proficiency in short cycles and reports results in real time to teachers and students. It also provides a student area with calendars, schedules, and communication tools.Notable results  New York City’s iZone launched in 2010, so there are no end-of-year academic results from Brownsville’s new blended program as of yet. Diploma Plus’s national office plans to use Browsnville’s results, as well as the results of other schools in the network, for initial research and evaluation about incorporating online learning across its program. In terms of financial results, the program is not designed as a cost saver, although school leaders believe the blended model will allow them to extend access to content and increase learning time, while holding costs constant. They do not expect significant changes in labor costs.On the horizon  Mervis says he expects that DPNet will continue to facilitate experimentation with anytime, anyplace learning across the Diploma Plus network. He says that in terms of tool development, Diploma Plus is interested in a tool that allows students to give feedback about online tasks and lessons, like a Pandora thumb’s up. He also says that Diploma Plus is working to make sure students have hardware and high-speed broadband access during non-school hours to deliver on the full potential of anywhere, anytime learning.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

One of the office’s goals is to increase learning options for every student. As such, officials at CAIU identified online learning as a potential medium through which to expand course catalogs and fill teaching gaps for its member schools. The Intermediate Unit set up the Capital Area Online Learning Association (CAOLA) in 2009 to pursue this idea.After sending out a proposal request, CAOLA screened several possible partners and decided to contract with EdisonLearning (Provost Systems at the time) to provide the online curriculum. CAOLA favored EdisonLearning because it felt that the online-content provider offered a variety of high quality, rigorous solutions, ranging from full-time online to supplemental. They liked that its customizable, modular content could align to district scope and sequence and that districts could custom create courses according to their particular learning objectives. It also contracted with Apex Learning to provide Advanced Placement courses, which EdisonLearning did not offer at that time.CAOLA launched in June 2009, with an online summer school program for 14 students. By the fall of 2009, 149 students enrolled in 175 courses, and by the fall of 2010, 1,224 students were taking 3,332 courses. Five percent of these students enrolled full time, and the rest used the course offerings as a supplement. Twenty Pennsylvanian school districts participated in the CAOLA program, some of which were outside of the CAIU region. At this time, CAOLA expanded its program to grades 6–8. Because EdisonLearning had not yet developed coursework for middle school, CAOLA contracted with Aventa Learning for these grades.Blended model  In CAOLA’s model, EdisonLearning, Aventa Learning, and Apex Learning provide content and teachers for their respective courses and grades, although districts can unbundle and use their own teachers if they prefer. Districts can also modify content if they choose. Students take CAOLA courses at a workstation in the back of a traditional classroom or in their school’s computer lab, in keeping in the online-lab model of blended learning. They can also self-blend by taking courses on their own off campus. Instruction is mostly asynchronous; students and online teachers communicate through email and forum postings. For synchronous tutoring help, CAOLA students use www.smarthinking.com or chat with their online teachers during virtual office hours.CAOLA has tried to create a “single sign-on” for its high school students, despite its use of both EdisonLearning and Apex Learning. Middle school students sign on directly to Aventa Learning. All three vendors provide their own LMS, including gradebook, assessments, e-textbooks, e-planners, reporting, and communication tools.Districts pay CAOLA a membership fee to participate, based on enrollment numbers. This fee covers CAOLA’s costs for managing the online program. Districts also pay a per-enrollment fee directly to the content providers. In addition, districts must support their students taking CAOLA courses by providing a face-to-face mentor for each student.Notable results  In many cases, districts save money by participating in CAOLA, because they can avoid hiring a traditional teacher when class sizes are too small to constitute a full load. For example, a district recently paid $28,211 in course and membership fees to provide 36 different courses for a mere 40 students—a significant cost savings compared to providing such course diversity in a traditional model. They also save by reducing textbook costs.Performance results do not yet suggest a pattern because the program is still in its infancy. Based on anecdotal evidence to this point, CAOLA’s staff believes that students perform much better in their online courses when districts diligently support them with face-to-face mentors.On the horizon  CAOLA hopes to move to a single content provider in the future, as soon as one arises that can meet all its needs. Alternatively, multiple suppliers could work if their systems were able to integrate seamlessly for the user and student information systems.CAOLA also plans to partner with other intermediate units in the state. Holly Brzycki, the supervisor of online learning, explains that districts are losing too much money each year to cyber schools, and thus feel increasing pressure to offer their own programs.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Two to three rotations per day, four days of school per week, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.Program backgroundHistory and context  Carpe Diem Collegiate High School and Middle School (CDCHS) began in 2000 as a trad-itional high school that served nearly 300 students in face-to-face classrooms. In 2003 its executive director, Rick Ogston, began developing the blended model now in use. In 2005, the owners of the church facility that CDCHS was renting decided to sell the property. Without a building, Ogston and his team felt they had no option but to quickly transform their model. Within a few months, school leaders put in place the new blended model and moved to a temporary location in a University of Phoenix building. In 2006, they relocated to a new building, which was custom designed for their blended approach.Blended model  The new building has 300 individual cubicles and computers housed in a central learning center, which is similar in layout to a call center. Students attend class four days a week, although the days are longer (8 a.m. to 4 p.m.). Students attend 145 school days per year and receive a total of 1,007 hours of instruction. Typically there is little or no outside homework. Students rotate throughout the day between online activities in the learning center and face-to-face classroom instruction, where a “coach,” or teacher, re-teaches, enhances, or applies the material introduced online. Each rotation lasts 55 minutes. Students complete the online/face-to-face cycle two to three times a day. Physical education is actual, not virtual.CDCHS only hires six full-time certified teachers: one each for math, language arts, science, physical education, social studies, and electives. These teachers serve as the coaches during the face-to-face classroom time. They teach all of the students in the school; for example, the math teacher alone provides all face-to-face math instruction that the 273 students receive throughout the week. Furthermore, the same teacher teaches all grade levels, so that teacher is able to provide continuity as students progress through the system. The charter district consortium provides special education services, which means that CDCHS splits this cost with another school. CDCHS pays its teachers at or above district salaries and offers a better benefit plan than that of other schools in the area. The plan includes state retirement.During online instruction periods, “assistant coaches” offer direction and help. Assistant coaches are highly qualified paraprofessionals in accordance with state standards, but are not necessarily certified teachers. The school has two administrators, one serving as principal and the other as guidance counselor and office administrator. The guidance counselor helps place students in the right courses for their ability—so that students can advance at their own pace— and arranges for community internships.CDCHS uses e2020 for content, which it prefers because of its multi-modal pedagogical approach; students must type, listen, watch video instruction, read text, explore links, and take short-cycle assessments. The school doubles up on assessment by contracting with Acuity to conduct extra-curricular assessments, which enables the school not to rely on e2020 or state assessments alone to assess the effectiveness of e2020 content. e2020 also manages the student gradebook and sends out automatic weekly results emails to parents.PowerSchool provides the student information system, including gradebook, report cards, and the attendance records that are sent to the state.Notable results  In 2010, CDCHS ranked first in its county in student performance in math and reading and ranked among the top 10 percent of Arizona charter schools. A similar tale played out in 2009 when, based on its scores on the Arizona Instrument to Measure Standards (AIMS) test, CDCHS ranked first in the county in student performance for almost all grade levels and subjects. In almost all instances, at least 90 percent of the students at CDCHS passed the test in all grade levels and subjects tested. In many instances, 100 percent of the students passed.Savings on labor costs are substantial because of a model that allows for only six certified teacher FTEs (plus various support staff) for 273 students. In addition, CDCHS’s new building, opened in 2006, contains only five traditional classrooms, which is fewer than half as many as a traditional school requires for a similar enrollment level. The building cost $2.7 million to build. In comparison, a building currently in the planning stages in the same neighborhood, the traditional Desert View Academy, will cost roughly $12 million and accommodate only 200 more students than CDCHS, which means that it will cost more than twice the capital expenditure per pupil as the CDCHS building.Businessweek recognized CDCHS as one of the top high schools in America in its 2009 report, and U.S. News & World Report gave CDCHS the same recognition in its 2010 report.On the horizon  On the learning tools side, Ogston anticipates that someday CDCHS will have access to an integrated system that seamlessly manages assessment data from Acuity, curricula from e2020, and student data from PowerSchool. The Arizona Charter School Association, of which he is a member, is currently working on this project.On the policy side, he notes that federal stimulus funding often has replaced—not added to—education allocations from the states, and these federal monies usually carry more restrictive, time intensive, and unwieldy auditing and compliance mandates, thus leaving schools with less money than before the stimulus funds were offered. He also says that because funding is unpredictable and unstable, school administrators are unnecessarily crippled in their budgeting and planning abilities.Ogston recently obtained approval from the State Board for Charter Schools to scale the CDCHS model. He is beginning with a new school that will offer two days per week of face-to-face instruction with the rest offered remotely online. He plans to base this school in Yuma and market it to students who are unmotivated by the traditional paradigm.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

The mission of Chicago International is to provide, through innovation and choice, an attractive and rigorous college-preparatory education that meets the needs of today’s students.Chicago International takes a portfolio approach to managing schools. The board contracts with four education management organizations (EMOs). It divides responsibilities among the central administration, EMO staff, and campus educators. The central administrative office is responsible for the strategic management of the network and its partners, as well as facilities maintenance and improvement; legal compliance with local, state, and federal mandates; out-of-school activities; and fundraising objectives. The EMOs are in charge of hiring a dynamic and highly-qualified school staff, providing professional development, designing and adopting curricula, and managing faculty and staff to meet performance goals.Blended model  Chicago International created a new EMO that will replicate the Quest to Learn (Q2L) model in Chicago (see the “Quest to Learn” profile). With the support of the MacArthur Foundation, Chicago International has applied to open three schools for grades 6–12 (one to open in September 2011, two to open in 2012) that use the design principles of games to create highly immersive project-based learning experiences. The idea behind Q2L is to engage students from a diversity of backgrounds through game-like learning, which draws on the intrinsic qualities of games and their design to engage students in a deep exploration of academic subject matter. Within the context of games, players participate in virtual worlds, use strategic thinking to make choices, solve complex problems, seek content knowledge, receive constant feedback, and consider the point of view of others.The new entity will be a division of Civitas Schools, one of Chicago International’s four EMO providers originally incubated within its portfolio. Though it is still in the initial planning phase, Chicago International does not expect to do a pure replication of the Q2L model. It intends to maintain its core curriculum, but enhance it with the Q2L project-based instructional approach. Additionally, Chicago International plans to implement its cultural and behavioral models, school calendar, and assessment program.Like Q2L, the new set of schools will make use of digital resources according to the face-to-face-driver model of blended learning. Teachers will assign online materials and games to model or extend the thinking around the main learning points in the unit of study.Notable results  The program is still too early to provide results.On the horizon  If the model proves effective, Chicago International may extend the same design to its existing network of 6th- through 12th-grade classrooms.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

He decided in May 2010 that he wanted Chicago students to enjoy the advantages of high quality blended learning by September of that year. He believed blended learning presented an instructionally beneficial and fiscally responsible way to expand learning time for CPS students. With help from The Chicago Public Education Fund, CPS identified 15 elementary schools to test pilot the new initiative. In August 2010, Mayor Richard Daley announced the new initiative—called Additional Learning Opportunities (ALO)—which used blended learning to provide students with another 90 minutes of learning time as an afterschool program each school day.At the press conference for the launch, Daley said, “For many years I have argued that we must extend Chicago’s school year and school day because we know that the more time a child spends learning, the more he or she retains and the better they do year after year.” Indeed, Chicago students spent less time in the classroom each year than the national average. Daley said that compared to students in Houston, for example, Chicago students spent 30 percent less time in class on an annual basis. The challenge, however, was to provide additional learning time without having to revisit the collective bargaining agreement in place with the teachers’ union. Daley and Huberman hoped to find an answer in blended learning combined with partnerships with community organizations.Blended model  The district launched the initiative in two waves—with five schools beginning the initiative in November 2010 and 10 additional schools beginning the initiative in January 2011. Across the 15 schools, 6,000 elementary school students participated in a mandatory 90-minute pilot ALO program. The district partnered with six community organizations, such as the YMCA, to provide adult facilitators for these 90 minutes. The community organizations were responsible for recruiting, staffing, training, and managing these facilitators. Often the community workers were activities leaders at the centers. Others were teachers, retired teachers, student teachers, parents, or other members of the community.To participate, facilitators had to complete 10 hours of training prior to the launch of the program and 20 hours of additional training over the course of the year; be at least 21 years old; hold at least an associate’s degree or be enrolled in college; and pass a standard background check. The organizations provided two facilitators per classroom, or approximately one adult per 15 students. Facilitators were paid roughly $15 per hour, although the amount varied depending on experience.To minimize transition time, students usually stayed in their homeroom classrooms for the program. Special education students who needed to work in a self-contained environment worked separately with a special education teacher and/or aide, who the district provided. At the start of each 90-minute block, the facilitators wheeled a computer cart, stocked with laptop computers and snacks, into each classroom. Although program scheduling varied somewhat by school, at most schools, students used the restroom and ate their snacks for the first few minutes while the facilitators set up the computers. Students then engaged in an online math program for 30 to 35 minutes and an online reading program for another 30 to 35 minutes. The last few minutes were for clean-up and dismissal.After requesting proposals from software vendors, the district selected MIND Research Institute’s ST Math as the online math provider. For reading, they contracted with Headsprout for grades 1–2 and Destination Reading and Earobics REACH for grades 3–8. District personnel recently requested another round of proposals to provide schools with additional software choices.During program hours, various personnel supported its operation, including the school’s principal or assistant principal, a security guard, an office assistant, and an education coordinator. The latter was a member of the school’s teacher staff and was responsible for helping to resolve classroom management issues, coach facilitators, and pull reports on a regular basis to monitor student and classroom progress. The district paid all of these personnel as district employees. Meanwhile, the community organizations employed a program coordinator for each school to run the operational aspects of the program and manage the facilitators. They also employed program supervisors, who provided support to three or four schools.The district office retained several school outreach managers, who each served as liaisons to a set of schools, supported implementation by sharing best practices, assisted with technical questions, and escalated problems when necessary.Notable results  At the time of publication, the program was too infant to produce demonstrable student achieve-ment results. District officials identified a few early observations about the implementation, however. They said that training facilitators about classroom management was critical before facilitators ever set foot in the classroom. The four to five hours of classroom management training that the program originally envisioned was not enough. Also, they found that back-up plans for offline activities were important to provide a substitute activity when the network went down. Finally, they said that carefully selecting software vendors was essential. Much of the online content on the market seemed geared toward classrooms with experienced teachers who could guide the students through the system. For Chicago, the software needed to be more engaging and completely hands off.On the horizon  The district did not yet have expansion plans. Faced with a roughly $700 million deficit, CPS faced the challenge of carefully prioritizing programs going forward.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

City Prep’s main focus is on creating and managing new schools, but it will also offer turn-around solutions to existing operators.Blended model  City Prep aspires to integrate the best of technology tools, online collaboration experiences, and face-to-face teaching throughout the context of a day. The model’s architects believe that the secret to maximizing blended learning is this integration of the best parts of all available options. School personnel will identify each student’s strengths and challenges at the start, and then prescribe the right mix of learning pathways to maximize the student’s potential.Academies will be open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., five days per week, and most students will be on-site the whole time. This gives urban students a safe, supervised environment and fosters the completion of homework. The school will customize each student’s schedule to whatever maximizes outcomes for that student. For example, some upper-division students will be online 80 percent of the time, whereas incoming 9th graders might work online 50 percent of the time. Some online coursework will have a face-to-face teacher, whereas others will provide an online teacher.The model calls for the deployment of core coursework, advanced coursework, project-based learning, and internships to help each student be ready for college. For the project-based learning, students will participate twice a week in four-hour blocks of team experiences. For example, 10th, 11th, and 12th graders will do a community service project that includes studying an area of their surrounding neighborhood, researching the neighborhood online, mapping it, interviewing local shopkeepers, and presenting findings. The same grade levels will also participate in internships with companies and organizations in and around the neighborhood.Students will use the Edmodo platform to collaborate with each other and with their teachers. Integrated units of study on Edmodo will include multiple learning strategies and multiple assessments. Some assignments will require the collaboration of a team of students.City Prep will make extensive use of open education resources (OER) including HippoCampus and OER Commons. City Prep plans to break even by the end of the second year. It plans to account for the upfront investment as a capital expense and amortize it. The daily operating budget will come from per-pupil attendance funds. Differentiated and distributed staffing will support a long day and year and drop sufficient margin to partially self-fund network expansion.Notable results  Although City Prep is still in the planning stages, the school’s founders believe that their model provides a potential antidote against some of the underachievement that has plagued inner-city schools. For example, inner-city boys tend to feel peer pressure to aspire for mediocrity or even failure, which encourages them to “dumb themselves down.” With online learning, however, the online teachers can acknowledge and celebrate a student’s achievements in their online communications, sheltered from the observation of peers.Furthermore, City Prep’s team believes that the self-pacing that online learning facilitates makes teaching some subjects, such as mathematics, much more efficient. Students who are far ahead or behind can work at precisely the right level in an online lab environment. The school’s goal is for all students to complete at least Algebra II, to earn college credit through advanced placement or dual enrollment, and to gain admission to at least one college.On the horizon  City Prep plans to open its doors in September 2011. Its first partnership is with Brooklyn City Prep Charter School in New York City. City Prep also anticipates opening two schools in New Jersey in 2011.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Like many other online-learning companies, it has begun to field more requests to implement its program in brick-and-mortar schools, rather than just for individual students working in a distributed setting outside of traditional schools.In 2009, the Pro-Vision charter school in Houston faced a predicament. Founded by a former professional football player, Pro-Vision originally was organized to serve middle school boys. But when 20 of its graduating 8th graders did not want to attend a traditional high school, Pro-Vision did not have the resources to expand to serve high school students. School leaders decided to partner with Connections Academy to solve the problem.Pro-Vision’s need created an opportunity for Connections Academy to take the leap into brick-and-mortar blending as a starting point for expanding a whole-school blended solution. The Vision Academy, a combination of the two institutions, opened its doors as a school within a school for Pro-Vision 9th graders in the fall of 2009 and was co-located in the Pro-Vision facility.Blended model  The Vision Academy students spend their day in a specially outfitted learning lab for all academic subjects. Connections Academy provides the learning management system and online teachers, who deliver all course content. These teachers are located throughout the country but are all Texas credentialed. Connections Academy also provides print textbooks and novels as well as hands-on science and related materials. High school students typically spend about 50 percent of their time at a computer when engaged in a Connections Academy course.Two face-to-face paraprofessional coaches assist and encourage the students as they monitor the classroom. The Connections Academy learning management system allows the online teachers to direct the activities of the face-to-face coaches. Students spend significant time communicating synchronously with their online teacher in the “LiveLesson” Web conferencing room, as well as through email and on the phone through Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP).Students join with the rest of the Pro-Vision school for lunch and other activities, such as gardening, art, and sports. But for their academics, they change back into their white shirts and ties and return to the learning lab. Connections Academy offers several Internet-based extracurricular clubs as well, such as chess, robotics, and a Connections Academy newspaper.Notable results  The Vision Academy students produced respectable results for language arts, science, and social studies for the 2009–10 school year. Connections Academy, however, found that its online teachers and curriculum were not enough to ensure the young men mastered some of the math concepts. Despite the program’s emphasis on extensive synchronous work, students often turned to their face-to-face coaches for help. But since the coaches were not trained math teachers, their ability to tutor was limited. For the 2010–11 school year, Connections Academy therefore decided to swap a credentialed math teacher in place of one of the on-site coaches.Initial feedback also suggested that the students were restless from sitting and needed more moving around. For the 2010–11 school year, Connections Academy focused on better pacing for the day with more small-group and class collaboration. The model retained the idea of starting with each student’s specific needs, however, and then building appropriate collaborations from there, which is the opposite of the traditional model.Although Vision Academy has been implemented as a pilot, the standard cost of this blended model per student is about $5,000 per year for the full curriculum, plus another $3,000 per student for the physical elements; for example, facility, on-site activities, etc. This $7,000 to $8,000 price tag could be a cost savings for some urban school districts, but does not save money in others. The price is sensitive to whether on-site coaches need to be subject experts.On the horizon  Vision Academy expanded to serve 10th graders for the 2010–11 school year. This brought its total student enrollment to approximately 43 students and up to three on-site coaches.Connections Academy has focused on evolving the data interface between the online teachers, learning management system, and face-to-face teachers or coaches. Traditionally the system has been geared toward interfacing between an online teacher and a parent or family member for students in a distributed environment. Connections Academy sees an opportunity to revise that approach so that the online teacher works collaboratively with the face-to-face coaches of a co-located group of students instead. Connections Academy has also found that mobile phones are helpful in improving online/on-site, teacher/coach collaboration.Mickey Revenaugh, executive vice president at Connections Academy, said that the science behind how online teachers, on-site coaches, and parents best work together to deliver education is still nascent. Connections Academy—and the online-learning world in general—are working to specify each adult’s role. She believes that as on-site coaches better understand how to master their role, blended learning will improve.During the 2010–11 school year, Connections Academy began providing a similar whole-school solution for about 60 upper-grade high school students in Prince George’s County, Md. It is applying and improving upon its Vision Academy model and expects that through these early iterations, its blending strategy will continue to improve.Apart from its whole-school blended turnaround solution, Connections Academy continues to offer curriculum course by course for students to self-blend. Mississippi has outsourced its entire state virtual school program—approximately 3,000 course enrollments—to Connections Academy. Connections Academy is also providing roughly 2,500 course enrollments to Missouri.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Over the ensuing two decades, Cornerstone Schools set up three schools and had several successes, including earning recognition from the Heritage Foundation and the National Commission of Time and Learning and receiving a personal visit from George W. Bush, who was governor of Texas at the time. By 2010, Cornerstone Schools had a high school graduation rate of 97 percent, and 93 percent of graduates went on to post-high school study. Cornerstone Primary was ranked the top elementary school in Detroit by Excellent Schools Detroit for 2010.A few years ago, Detroit’s mayor urged Cornerstone Schools to expand and serve more students in the city. Cornerstone Schools’ board of directors realized, however, that the school could not scale well without a change in business model. As an independent school, Cornerstone Schools required parents to contribute $3,900 in tuition each year to help cover the roughly $10,000 per-student costs. Donations and fundraisers covered the remaining $6,100 per student. But the annual payment of $3,900 was too expensive for 90 percent of families in the area. The board of directors believed they needed public revenue to scale the model and serve more students.To that end, Cornerstone Schools converted two of its independent K–8 schools to charter schools, under a separate entity called Conerstone Charter Schools. “We plan to begin the next part of our journey with a charter focus,” said Clark Durant, founding chairman of the board for Cornerstone Schools. Durant and others recruited Robert Sommers to help design Cornerstone Charter Schools.The board plans to open the first Cornerstone Charter Schools high school in the fall of 2011. The new school, named Cornerstone Health High School, will be fully operational in four years with a total of 500 students. It will have a healthcare focus, although it will not be a career-technical school. Instead, students will approach traditional academic standards through an applied, industry-specific lens to bring relevance and a career mindset to the learning. Students will also be required to complete a “life-success”-oriented curriculum that goes beyond academics. The program will include content related to community service, cultural competency, character, free-enterprise economics, creativity, financial literacy, health and wellness, and more.Blended model  Cornerstone Health High School’s designs represent a departure from traditional thinking about the role of teachers, grade levels, assessments, and college preparation. The staffing design disaggregates the teacher role into four parts:Relationship Managers develop deep, mentoring relationships with students during their four years in school and the early years of college.Relevance Managers are connected to the health industry and can help their students engage in increasingly complex, relevant, and applied projects and internships.Rigor Managers are virtual faculty for the online coursework.Discipline Managers handle behavior problems and ensure building safety.Students will not have a set schedule. They will meet together in pods of 50 students, representing a variety of ages and abilities. Rather than having grade levels, Cornerstone Health High School will categorize students by their academic and social maturity. They advance as they achieve new levels of academic and social maturity, without regard to the calendar year. Beginning students will have more structured assignments and hands-on assistance to help them advance to an intermediate and then advanced level. With each advancement, they gain increased flexibility and control. They can ultimately progress to the “professional” level, where they enroll in college courses, have maximum flexibility, engage in internships, and even earn an industry credential.Each student will have a personal computer station. An online platform will deliver most of the foundational content. Students will progress as they demonstrate competence. They will only receive a grade at the end-of-course assessment. Formative assessments will not factor into their grades, but will instead help the students gauge when they are ready to pass the summative assessment. Students can only earn two grades: an “A” or a “Not Yet.”The school plans to use Michigan Virtual School curriculum for many of the online teachers and courses. Sommers is still selecting online providers to deliver courses in character, health and wellness, financial skills, and other whole-person topics. He is also talking to the National Academy Foundation about virtualizing some of its material to create modules and assessment relevant to the health industry.Sommers’ past experience with online learning has convinced him that the format has the potential to shorten the timeline for students to get through a course. He notes, however, that students generally have difficulty learning 5 to 7 percent of the material online. Rigor managers, therefore, will be responsible for delivering the roughly 95 percent of the course that students generally can master on their own, while on-site relationship and relevance managers provide face-to-face support to target the problematic 5 percent of the subject.Notable results  Although still in the planning stage, Cornerstone Health High School has set goals for its financial performance. The school intends to be self-sustaining on state funding alone, which amounts to an average of $7,500 to $8,000 per pupil (excluding the higher funding for special education students). Sommers plans to capture personnel efficiencies by using one relationship manager per 50 students and by a high student-to-teacher ratio for rigor managers. He hopes relevance managers will be community volunteers who work pro bono. Ideally, relevance managers will find internships and projects for their students that allow them to meet off-campus in community and business centers to reduce school facility costs.On the horizon  Although Cornerstone Health High School has a health theme, Cornerstone Charter Schools may eventually open charter schools that have separate themes for each 50-student pod, or even individual themes. Sommers plans to start small and see what works. “The need in Detroit is so great,” he said.Sommers noted three areas where he is working to develop the technology he needs for the new school. First, he said that he has not found off-the-shelf student relationship management software to manage the interface between relationship, relevance, and rigor managers, deal with a program that does not use grade levels, and customize to the other specifics of his design. Second, he is looking for software to manage all the formative and summative assessments across courses so that no student falls through the cracks. Third, he needs to virtualize team-based projects and makes project-based learning repeatable, which will drive cost efficiencies.In terms of policy needs, Sommers said that the need is for policy that is child centered and not system centered. “Any policy about procedure needs to be changed to policy about performance and meeting student needs,” he said.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Students complete the remainder of coursework online as long as they maintain at least a “C” grade.Program backgroundHistory and context  Albuquerque Public Schools, a 93,000-student school district, set up the Albuquerque Evening School nearly 90 years ago to provide dropout- and credit-recovery services, primarily to war veterans. The Evening School used a high school building during the traditional school’s off hours, but in recent years it began to outgrow this space. District officials considered shuttering the Evening School as spending cuts strained the district’s budget.Instead, the district decided in 2009 to use the Evening School to pilot a new blended-learning model. The new mission was to provide alternative education opportunities through a variety of electronic delivery methods that promote independence and excellence in learning. The model promised to save money and thus operate within the confines of the district’s tighter budget. The model also promised to be a strong fit with the majority of the school’s clientele. Students at the Evening School frequently had trouble staying in school because of their day jobs. The administration hoped that by moving to a blended model, students could use their newfound time flexibility to work while also completing diploma requirements. Surrounding schools supported the idea because they generally found this group of students challenging to serve and were glad for an alternative.In the spring of 2010, the alternative school opened its doors under the name of eCADEMY and offered its first 11 courses to students across the district’s other high schools. The district also began constructing a new building to house eCADEMY. Dr. Tom Ryan, who led the effort to set up eCADEMY, began working with the administration and the teachers union to define a new charter for the school, including how to adapt existing teacher contracts for the new model.Blended model  Currently, eCADEMY’s computer labs are open to students from 3:10 p.m. to 9 p.m. Until the new eCADEMY facility was completed in April 2011, eCADEMY students shared a facility with a traditional school.At the start of the spring, fall, and winter semesters, students meet face-to-face with eCADEMY faculty. Students who maintain a C grade or better do not have to show up on the physical campus again during the course, although some choose to use the computer labs on campus. Teachers are available to meet with students during physical office hours if students want further face-to-face interaction.New Mexico’s seat-time requirement stipulates that students must log on to a virtual classroom for as many days as they would be required to appear in a traditional classroom. Thus, students generally must log on to the virtual classroom five days per week. A designated mentor—either a teacher or parent—receives alerts if a student fails to log on enough.The school offers all subjects online, except for several face-to-face electives, such as jewelry making. eCADEMY’s faculty departments create courses themselves, although they use or incorporate content from the state’s virtual high school, Ideal New Mexico (Ideal-NM), and the National Repository of Online Courses (NROC), a free open-source repository of online course content.Blackboard provides the learning management system, which includes short-cycle assessments to help teachers customize pacing for each student. Courses generally include end-of-the-week assessments. Some also require a pre-test at the beginning of the week. All schools in the Albuquerque district upload student information and the active directory into Blackboard.Teachers at eCADEMY earn $190 per semester per student per class. The school arrived at this rate by dividing an average full-time teacher salary by the average total number of students that teachers would have if they were teaching a full load at a traditional school. Officials negotiated with the teachers union to agree to this new pay formula. Class size remains at roughly 30 students per class, and most teachers offer two to three classes. eCADEMY opens the opportunity for teachers to work all year, which substantially improves their earning potential.Notable results  eCADEMY has realized significant cost savings with its labor expense because of its unique teacher pay formula. In a traditional setting, a teacher earns roughly $5,000 per class. At eCADEMY, by paying teachers a set $190 per semester per student per class, the school can offer classes for only a few students, at a rate of only $190 per student, rather than the $5,000 minimum charge. This offers the school flexibility to offer courses for smaller numbers of students per class.The program stands out for its facility cost savings. Ryan said that a typical comprehensive high school for 2,000 to 2,500 full-time students in the area is about 450,000 square feet at a cost of $160 to $200 per foot. The new eCADEMY building, in contrast, is less than 100,000 square feet at a cost of less than $130 per square foot. “eCADEMY will be the least expensive high school we have ever built,” Ryan said. The district is able to capture these savings because the building does not include a gym, shares campus space with another school building, has a small cafeteria that doubles as the multi-purpose meeting area, has very few specialized rooms, and has a small parking lot.eCADEMY is less than 25 percent of the size of a typical comprehensive school in the area, but it will be able to accommodate the same number of students. This efficiency is the result of the school’s long hours, which are from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., which allows the district to spread occupancy over more hours. The smaller facility leads to the reduction of attendant operating costs, including custodial, security, utilities, and cafeteria expenses.eCADEMY also has found savings through the elimination of textbooks and of paper reproduction and storage expenses, as well as through the reduction of aides and support staff.During the spring 2010 pilot testing period, eCADEMY had a 70 percent retention rate. This compares to the 50 percent retention rate before the school moved to a hybrid model. That summer, eCADEMY enrolled over 500 students and reported a 90 percent pass rate among these students. Most students attending eCADEMY took courses for credit recovery while still enrolled in their home high schools. This makes it difficult to ascribe a graduation rate result specifically to the work of eCADEMY.Teachers at eCADEMY keep logs on when they contact parents. Dave Wells, the principal of eCADEMY, reports that there has been a 35 percent increase in parental contacts with the blended program and that his work has shifted from disciplining students in the old face-to-face environment to working with parents toward the success of their children.On the horizon  eCADEMY has been challenged to keep up with the growing demand for the program. New Mexico passed a graduation requirement for the class of 2013 that mandated that each student complete an online, Advanced Placement, or dual-credit course. Ryan said that this requirement could push eCADEMY’s enrollment up to 6,000 students in the next two years. One constraint on growth is that eCADEMY requires its teachers to obtain district certification in online teaching, and this makes rapid expansion difficult.Ryan and district leaders are considering entering into public-private partnerships to enhance eCADEMY’s programs. For example, Ryan is thinking about partnering with Sprint to provide free 3G connectivity for students, in exchange for allowing Sprint to use school facilities for cell towers. He also plans to work with the Albuquerque Hispano Chamber of Commerce and other community members to allow students to access eCADEMY courses on their physical premises.In the future, the eCADEMY staff would like to evolve its system to move away from semester-based courses in favor of rolling enrollments. They also anticipate that the system’s use of grade levels will become more fluid. As for tools, Ryan notes that an iPad-type device could become a helpful tool for giving eCADEMY students mobile connectivity, although such devices do not yet allow administrators to push out programming to a user network.In addition, Ryan hopes to develop more of a cloud environment instead of storing student information in a data center. He plans to increase help-desk support for eCADEMY to make assistance for students available 24 hours, not just during office hours. Finally, Ryan would like to see an integrated system that collects assessment data, identifies where students need help relative to specific state standards, and generates customized interventions for each student.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Founded in 1992 by American entrepreneur Chris Whittle, EdisonLearning partners with state governments, districts, and schools to deliver education solutions. These range from providing full-school start up and turnaround to closing a specific achievement gap to helping a good school find incremental improvements.EdisonLearning bases all of its engagements on the principal of solidifying “Four Cornerstones” of school excellence:Top talentCulture of engagement and aspirationDemanding content and customized instructionAchievement-driven managementDuring the 2009–10 school year, EdisonLearning served almost a half a million students across all its product and service offerings in 25 states and internationally.Blended model  Like Florida Virtual School and operators that offer full-time virtual schools, EdisonLearning offers a number of products and services for online learning. These include eCourses, which are modular online courses it has developed for high school students; the eAcademy, a comprehensive, turnkey solution that allows educational institutions to set up their own online programs, and eSchoolware, a learning management system and online gradebook. Because of EdisonLearning’s various product offerings, schools use EdisonLearning to blend in a variety of ways. For example, EdisonLearning licenses eCourses to intermediate units and districts to use in their full-time online programs and blended-learning environments. The Capital Area Intermediate Unit in Pennsylvania, featured earlier in this report, contracts with EdisonLearning to deliver the platform and content for its online program (see the “Capital Area Online Learning Association” profile).This profile focuses on two of EdisonLearning’s main blended models: its eight dropout- recovery centers in Ohio for students who have left the public school system without graduating, and its use of blended products to facilitate turnarounds at its brick-and-mortar schools under management.Dropout-solutions centers In the fall of 2010, EdisonLearning opened eight dropout-solutions centers in Ohio—four in Columbus and four in Cleveland. EdisonLearning worked with the Ohio State Department of Education, local school districts, and communities to set up the centers, which are conveniently located to optimize ease of student access (for example, located on a public transportation route). Each center has a dedicated classroom for small group or individual direct instruction and tutoring and a technology lab for delivering online courses. Solution centers offer a flexible schedule that provides students the option to attend one of several sessions during the day. Each center has a professional staff, which generally consists of a director, administrative personnel, certified teachers, paraprofessionals, and guidance coaches.The on-site teachers grade the open-response portion of assessments, which constitute 25 percent of each course’s total assessment content. The learning management system provides automated grading of the remaining 75 percent of material.Blended products EdisonLearning is increasingly moving in the direction of incorporating online learning into the more than 40 brick-and-mortar schools that it manages. The executive team believes this is a natural progression for them. Given that they started with brick-and-mortar schools and then became involved with online learning, blending the two makes strategic sense.EdisonLearning has started offering its menu of eCourses, eAcademy solutions, and eSchoolware tools to the physical schools under its management. To date, these schools have used these courses mostly according to the online-lab model of blended learning. For example, San Jose–Edison Academy, a high performing K–8 school in Southern California, needed to better serve students needing geometry instruction. Another school in Phoenixville, Penn., lost its Spanish teacher in the middle of the semester. In both of these cases, EdisonLearning was able to deploy its online-learning resources to offer online labs almost overnight.The company continues to explore different models for implementing a blended solution in its schools.Notable results  Academic achievement results for the dropout-solutions centers are unavailable because of the program’s infancy. The program has opened eight centers since its inception in the fall of 2010.As for its various blended products, EdisonLearning has seen positive results from the application of its online products and services in blended and fully online programs. For example, a rural district in Pennsylvania that is part of the Capital Area Online Learning Association transitioned its summer credit-recovery program to a fully online program using EdisonLearning’s online products and experienced a 12.5 percent increase in the number of students who were able to recover credit. The district realized a savings of nearly $5,000.Similarly, EdisonLearning’s Provost Academy South Carolina charter school partner has experienced positive results through the use of the eAcademy program. It has achieved a 74 percent course completion rate and a 92 percent passing rate by serving a population in which 60 percent of students come from families living below the poverty line. In addition, student scores on the SAT at Provost Academy South Carolina are significantly outpacing students nationally and across the state, according to EdisonLearning officials.On the horizon  EdisonLearning believes it will have an advantage in the blended-learning space because it has such a broad set of brick-and-mortar schools and online products within its operation, which it can use to test and iterate rapidly. Evo Popoff, senior vice president of achievement solutions, believes that in the future, the company will have a highly developed matrix that lists school system needs on one axis, such as saving money, building student fluency with technology, graduating at-risk youth, and resolving teacher shortages. On the other axis, it will have a well-developed, tested, and predictable set of blended solutions. The company is moving forward to be able to match operator needs with appropriate solutions in each box of the matrix and thereby provide a customized implementation for each scenario.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

The school was founded in 2006 as a three-year high school, and it has since expanded to include grades 7–9. EPGY OHS focuses on providing rigorous academics for accelerated students to prepare them for college and their careers. The program includes three enrollment options: full-time, part-time, and single-course, to accommodate the varied needs and interests of its students. In 2010–11, EPGY OHS enrolled 289 students, of which roughly one-third were full-time, one-quarter were part-time, and the remainder were below part-time.Blended model  EPGY OHS delivers most of its course content online through various modalities. Much of the teacher-student interaction is synchronous in online, video-based, college-style seminars. These courses are arranged in a flexible, college-style schedule. For its science courses, the school mails physical lab kits and scientific equipment to students, and the students are responsible for mailing them back. The courses also include asynchronous, self-directed learning, which requires students to be disciplined about working independently and developing strong time-management skills.Beyond the online classrooms, students work closely over the Internet with instructors, counselors, and each other to achieve their academic and personal goals. The school supports a range of student clubs and organizations to help students connect with like-minded peers, both online and through face-to-face events. These include a student government, student newspaper, 3D modeling club, classic films club, exhibition space for digital creations, an engineering team that won an award at the Junior Engineering Technical Society (JETS) annual national competition, and many others. Jan Keating, EPGY OHS Head of School, said that students usually report feeling more socially connected at the OHS than when they were enrolled at a traditional school alone because the OHS allows them to engage with their intellectual and academic peers.The school hires doctorate holders from top universities to develop and teach its online courses. Students also have access to a broad range of academic and college counselors, who work individually with each student to help them chart their path.EPGY OHS falls within the parameters of blended learning, as defined in this report, because it offers an optional brick-and-mortar element to complement the remote delivery. Each year, the school invites incoming and returning students to participate in a residential summer program at Stanford University for two weeks in August, where they can choose from a selection of science labs, academic workshops, enrichment classes, and other activities.Tuition for the full-time program (four or more courses) is $14,000 for the 2010–11 school year. Part-time tuition (up to three courses) is $8,600, single-course tuition is $2,950, and the summer session is $3,200.Notable results  Many graduates of the EPGY OHS are accepted and matriculate to top tier universities of their choice, including: Stanford, Yale, CalTech, Johns Hopkins, Cornell, the University of Chicago, Reed, Williams, Oxford, and MIT. “Their education at EPGY OHS, both in its intellectual cultivation and its fostering of independence, equips them to succeed academically at the most rigorous and competitive post-secondary institutions,” Keating said. “All indications are that OHS graduates continue to perform at the highest academic levels after entering university.”On the horizon  EPGY will continue to expand its enrollment to keep pace with the growing interest among middle and high school students in advanced online learning.Representatives from EPGY were among a small group of experts assembled by a member of the U.S. House Committee on Education and Labor from whom recommendations regarding online education were to be considered as part of the reauthorizing of the Elementary and Secondary Education (ESEA) Act. Two suggestions of note were that first, the U.S. Department of Education should foster due diligence to differentiate between high- and low-quality online programs and second, the U.S. Department of Education should work to remove barriers to online learning in all their manifestations.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

The face-to-face teacher also serves as the online teacher.Program backgroundHistory and context  Fairmont Preparatory Academy (Fairmont) is the largest and oldest non-sectarian independent school in Orange County, Calif. In 2009 it began an e-learning strategy it called “build out from the core.” The first prong of this strategy was to bring the best technologies to the school’s traditional classrooms and develop teacher skills related to technology. Pursuant to this goal, Fairmont began equipping its classrooms with interactive whiteboards paired with an extensive library of flipcharts. It also invested in a Blackboard learning management system, available beginning in the fall of 2010, to facilitate parent-teacher-student communication.The second prong of Fairmont’s strategy was to offer new online courses to Fairmont students and then extend the reach of the courses beyond Fairmont’s constituents. Fairmont kicked off this strategy in the summer of 2010 with a blended summer school program.Blended model  Fairmont offered 18 blended courses during its summer 2010 program, including the following: Biology Honors and College Prep, Chemistry Honors and College Prep, English I/II/III, Pre-calculus, Algebra I, Algebra II/Trigonometry, Geometry, Health, U.S. History, World History, U.S. Government, and Economics. These courses served 156 students, grades 9–12. It made these courses available to students throughout Orange County for their summer needs because of budget cuts elsewhere. In total, 69 percent of enrollees were Fairmont Prep students and 31 percent were from other schools.Enrolled students attended class face-to-face two days per week for a total of six hours per week. During this time, teachers presented key lectures, assigned small group and individual work, conducted labs, and presented reviews. For the rest of the week, students worked online remotely by logging in to the Blackboard learning management system to access their coursework. The same teacher interacted with the students for both the face-to-face and online components of the class. They exchanged emails and held synchronous discussions with their students when not on-site. Teachers kept their students learning at the same pace so that they were in synch when they met face-to-face as a group.Teachers created their own content by modifying University of California (UC) College Prep and Aventa Learning courses.Notable results  Fairmont realized a 33 percent cost-per-student reduction over the summer, as it was able to spread its cost per course over a larger number of participants.As for academic performance, remediation students—meaning students who were retaking a course because of a failing grade—made moderate improvements in the blended environment compared to comparable remediation students in a traditional environment in prior years. Eighty-three percent of remediation students earned a higher grade in the blended course than they had in the traditional classroom. This compared to 80 percent in 2009 and 78 percent in 2008 for remediation students retaking courses in traditional classrooms.Students taking blended courses for credit advancement faired comparably, on average, to students in traditional classrooms taking the same courses in prior years. Eighty-eight percent of these students earned passing grades in the blended course compared to traditional classroom (same) courses in 2009 at 93 percent and 2008 at 88 percent.Teachers who participated in this rotation-model pilot study recommended the following best practices as a result of their experience:Schedule time in the computer lab once a week to make sure students are not struggling with their computer skills. For math, present a face-to-face overview of the major topics and have students practice problems in class and then follow-up with reading and other assignments online. Devote the first half-hour of class to questions from the online material. Structure wet lab science courses with two days of in-class activity and a third day of in-class labs. Post announcements each morning with the daily assignment to keep everyone at the same pace. Keep course navigation wide open to encourage exploration of the learning content. Determine attendance by meaningful interactions between student and teacher (such as synchronous communications, daily email questions and answers, discussion boards, and chat sessions). Set regular virtual office hours for students to contact the teacher with questions or homework issues. Tee-up virtual collaboration by assigning group projects in class. Give clear instructions and expectations for the use of the learning management syste. Give the final exam through the learning management system.Most of the teachers who participated—12 out of 15—agreed with the statement “I like it,” when asked about their experience teaching a blended course. The three teachers who expressed dissatisfaction cited concerns such as not rigorous enough content or too many English-language learners. During the pilot, teachers enjoyed the scheduling flexibility that came with being able to teach off-campus three of the five days per week.Student satisfaction with the pilot was relatively high. When asked, “Would you take a hybrid course again?” 74 percent said “yes,” 14 percent said “maybe—depends on course schedule,” and 14 percent said “no.”On the horizon  Fairmont has begun selling its blended courses outside of its school under the brand Thesys International. For the 2010–11 school year, it offered 36 courses, targeted mainly at independent schools and charters, and it launched additional pilot blended programs.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteOne Response to “Fairmont Preparatory Academy”Stephen Phelps, on January 1st, 2012 at 11:50 pm Said: I am intrigued by your blended program.

It will eventually serve grades 6–12. According to Mark Kushner, executive director of Flex Public Schools and a vice president at K12, Inc., it is the first in a series of Flex Academy schools that Flex Public Schools plans to launch in California. If K12, Inc. decides to partner with Flex Public Schools and other nonprofits to open Flex Academies across the country, the partnership will represent the first large-scale attempt to blend K12, Inc.’s turnkey online-delivery system, used in K12, Inc. virtual schools with over 70,000 full-time students and 50,000 part-time students worldwide, into a full-time brick-and-mortar setting.Blended model  SF Flex requires students to be present from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday at its brick-and-mortar facility in downtown San Francisco. The building was previously the San Francisco Press Club, and includes ballroom spaces that SF Flex has converted into large study rooms with library carrels, flat tables, and small-group collaboration spaces. It also has an Internet cafe and social areas with couches, as well as a science lab and other study areas in the basement. The school issues each student a laptop computer.Students meet with an academic adviser at the start of each semester to choose core and elective courses from K12, Inc.’s catalog of over 130 online courses. The K12, Inc. online platform is the starting point for delivering all curricula and assessments. Students primarily progress through their courses online, with the learning management system occasionally directing them to engage in offline enrichments, such as working with tangible manipulatives, reading physical books, or participating in a wet lab. A robust K12, Inc. database integrates information about student course progress, assessment results, attendance records, parent communications, and all other student information into one portal, called Total View, that teachers, advisors, administrators, and parents can access. Teacher-graded and computer-graded assessments determine mastery of objectives at the lesson, unit, and subject level.Despite this online delivery platform, SF Flex regards face-to-face teachers as a critical component of its model for core academic courses. Indeed, a central objective of the Flex model is to re-imagine the traditional teacher role. SF Flex will have at least two face-to-face English teachers, two math, two science, and two history, plus online teachers for electives to serve a student body of 500, once the school reaches full enrollment. The role of these teachers is to monitor student performance by using the integrated Total View dashboard and then call students into a physical classroom for specific tutoring—or for when the teacher wants the students to have a certain experience, such as a live debate about the Civil War. The student’s schedule changes every week, based on the blend of face-to-face and online that the teacher designates for the week. Physical teachers and students communicate both face-to-face and through email and threaded discussions. Online K12, Inc. teachers deliver most of the elective courses, which allows for the breadth of 130 options at an affordable price.The model at full size includes eight academic coaches, who assist the teachers as paraprofessionals, supervise students in the large study areas, and are responsible for helping students progress through the system. From 3 to 5 p.m., the school remains open for students to participate in clubs, office hours, and sports teams.Notable results  It is too early to indicate results because of the school’s recent opening.On the horizon  Flex Public Schools has four charters approved in California, and it has additional applications pending. The Flex model, in partnership with K12, Inc. enables operators like Flex Public Schools to use an integrated provider for each step of the delivery chain, including student recruitment, teacher recruitment, curriculum development, education delivery, professional development, assessment, the learning management system, and the student information system.In California, the Flex model is a “classroom-based” school model. The students and core teachers are both on-site. Accordingly, Kushner says that California’s SB 740 legislation, which prohibits a charter school from receiving any funding for nonclassroom-based instruction unless the State Board of Education determines its eligibility for funding, is not applicable to Flex schools. Nonetheless, Kushner believes that SB 740 regulations, which he helped write as chair of the California Advisory Commission on Charter Schools nine years ago, are outdated, as they are based on traditional independent study rules and were written before the explosion in online courses and other innovations. Kushner suggests that California revise these regulations to better anticipate a productive set of parameters for online learning and to allow more flexibility in blended schools for the good of students.In terms of technology, Kushner looks forward to the advent of improved adaptive learning technologies. He said that K12, Inc. is working on providing such technologies across its curriculum. Such a sophisticated technology platform is expensive to develop, however, because it requires multiple learning modalities for each instructional concept paired with complex assessment techniques.Furthermore, Kushner hopes that online content will increasingly improve in quality, as there are too many online programs that are simply “credit factories,” and this gives the entire field—virtual and blended schools—a bad name. Kushner believes efforts are needed to educate the public, districts, and states on what distinguishes the best online providers from low-cost and low-quality providers. “Not all online curriculum and service providers are made the same,” he said.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

The two districts formed a new team to launch what is now called the Florida Virtual School (FLVS), the nation’s first statewide, Internet-based public school. In 2003, the Florida Legislature voted to include FLVS in the K–12 state funding formula and approved a performance-based program in which the school would only receive the majority of per-pupil funds for those students who successfully completed and passed their courses. Spurred by this, FLVS continued to grow and served over 97,000 students in Florida alone in 2009–10. Currently offering more than 100 online courses, FLVS serves learners around the world and is an established leader in developing and providing K–12 online education solutions.Blended model  Because of its size and relatively long history, FLVS has evolved to deliver several models of online learning, including at least three of the blended-learning models described in this report. The following programs typify the virtual school’s strategies for allowing students to learn online and in brick-and-mortar environments:FLVS classic FLVS began as a virtual school serving students at a distance, and this delivery model continues to be the school’s bread and butter. In 2009–10, a total of 213,926 FLVS students completed courses in its virtual program, and a little over a third of those students simultaneously attended their local, traditional schools. Thus, FLVS’s primary and most popular version of blended learning, thinking in terms of enrollment numbers, is the self-blend model that takes place as part of the “classic” FLVS programming.ELearning Centers FLVS offers several packages to districts inside and outside of Florida that want to outsource portions of their education delivery to the virtual school, including franchise opportunities to in-state districts and FLVS Global School to districts outside of Florida. In recent years, an increasing number of districts have become interested in blending FLVS content and teachers into their brick-and-mortar programs.About three years ago, Florida districts began asking FLVS to provide its courses in a computer-lab setting. Most commonly, the districts wanted to bring Advanced Placement (AP) courses to rural schools. FLVS created a new ELearning Center (ELC) model that provided the FLVS course content, a certified online teacher, learning management system, gradebook, and other tools, while the school district provided the physical facility and on-site supervisors. Interest in this model has grown every year.For the 2010–11 school year, nearly 90 ELCs were in place to deliver 360 different labs to over 3,700 students throughout Florida. The on-site facilitators could communicate with FLVS about students’ progress; however, the FLVS teachers delivered all content and were responsible for each student’s academic success. As a result, FLVS earned the associated FTE funding. The FLVS registration system was not set up to provide the same online teacher for all co-located students, so FLVS had to override the system manually to ensure that all ELC students had the same teacher. This allowed the students to participate in a synchronous conversation with their co-located peers and complete group projects together.ELCs have been used in a variety of ways, including summer learning recovery. Brevard County Schools offered an intensive five-week program designed for middle school students at risk of not being promoted to high school because they had failed a course. Initial results point to an 83 percent success rate for students who completed the ELC recovery program, and district leaders plan to repeat the initiative in 2011.Virtual Learning Labs When Florida’s legislature passed a law to limit classroom size, many districts suddenly needed extra teachers and classrooms to comply, so they turned to FLVS. For example, in the fall of 2010, Miami–Dade County had nearly 8,000 students who needed over 9,000 half-credit courses to stay on track for on-time graduation, with limited teachers or classrooms available to them. FLVS quickly created a new delivery program, called Virtual Learning Labs (VLLs). VLLs house at least 50 students, who meet in any open room they can find at their school—a library, computer lab, and so forth—to complete courses with a certified FLVS virtual teacher. FLVS has set up VLLs in 45 sites.Each student has access to a computer and completes her coursework independently online with adult supervision but limited face-to-face delivery. Most commonly these are high school students taking everything from core to AP courses. As with other FLVS courses, the average student-to-online-teacher ratio is about 150-to-1, or about 25 students per class. FLVS cultivates a “high-touch” learning environment, where teachers engage students in one-on-one learning, group sessions, and tutoring.Recently FLVS initiated “VLL Tuesday,” which involves an FLVS teacher meeting face-to-face with his or her VLL students every week. This program allows students in the VLL program to bridge the virtual world with a more traditional face-to-face experience.iPrep Academy Miami–Dade Public Schools opened the iPrep Academy in the district’s administration building and initially served 25 students. It soon scaled the program to serve between 75 and 80 students for the 2009–10 school year. The brightly painted space features couches, breakout rooms, and a healthful food bar. The academy provides laptops for each student to use both at the center as well as at home to extend learning time. Most of the furnishings have been donated. Students drop in to take FLVS online courses and to participate in specific face-to-face small group workshops and tutoring. Except for the face-to-face elements, students are free to visit the center when they choose.iPrep plans to employ three full-time teachers, two administrators, two clerks, one computer technician, and one cafeteria manager once the school is staffed fully. Students must demonstrate an ability to work independently to gain admission to the school; they must have a 2.5 GPA, passing scores on the state assessment, and a solid attendance record at their traditional school. iPrep serves grades 11–12.Notable results  FLVS measures success by completion rates, meaning students complete the course with a D or higher. For FLVS Classic, completion rates for the past several years have been in the 83 to 85 percent range. Florida Virtual School is mainly paid when a student completes, which motivates teachers to seek the highest results from their students. This helps skew grade distribution toward As and Bs.For the ELCs and VLLs, early results indicate that students taking FLVS courses in these computer lab environments have completion rates similar to students who complete courses at home, but experience greater success with the following in place:Selectively chosen and fully trained lab facilitators who understand FLVS course navigation, can provide technical assistance, and will motivate students toward high achievement.Regular face-to-face visits from an online teacher, even if it is not the teacher assigned to the lab.In addition to helping improve academic performance, FLVS has the ability to offer districts a speedy solution to resolve course offerings gaps, teacher shortages, class-size reduction gaps, and budget challenges. For example, FLVS’s partnership with Miami–Dade saved the district from hiring an additional 50 to 75 face-to-face teachers at the start of the school year or face penalties of up to $3,000 per pupil for not meeting the legislative mandate for class size.Results for the iPrep Academy are not yet available.On the horizon  FLVS anticipates growth not just in its classic offering, but in blended environments such as ELCs, VLLs, and schools like iPrep. It is putting plans into place to bolster student success in all of these formats. For example, it has created a formalized training plan for lab facilitators and a schedule for regular on-site visits. It also anticipates the need for updates to its internal systems. The registration system, for example, currently does not automate the process for assigning all co-located students to the same online teacher. This necessitates manual placement of students. This labor-intensive process is fine for smaller ELCs, but does not easily scale for larger VLLs. FLVS supports the idea of non-traditional learning environments, such as iPrep, and is seeking ways to bring such innovative learning approaches to more locations.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight Institute2 Responses to “Florida Virtual School”Lisa Cohen, on January 22nd, 2012 at 2:13 pm Said: I am interested in citing this; who is the author on this piece?Michael B.

Low ratio of students to face-to-face teachers (8-to-1) during online delivery.Program backgroundHistory and context  District leaders from Grand Rapids Public Schools in Michigan first became interested in blended learning because of a desire to provide students with greater exposure to technology. To advance that objective, Grand Rapids began a blended program in three of its four Centers of Innovation—newer high schools with a college- and career-prep focus. The blended program launched at the 9th-grade level for the 2009–10 school year, but district leaders planned to add subsequent grades each year until the program served grades 9–12 by year four.Blended model  The blended program now in place for participating 9th graders includes six class periods per day—four core classes and two electives. The core classes are typically 55 to 70 minutes long and are fully online in a computer lab. The sizes of core classes remain the same as those in the district’s traditional high schools and range from 30 to 34 students. During the core class periods, four adults, including a lead instructor, special education instructor, paraprofessional, and tutor, work with the students in the lab. Whereas in the traditional model the average adult-to-student ratio is 1 or 2-to-32, in this blended model it jumps to 1-to-8. The district pays for this increase in personnel through a redirection of funds that include Section 31a funds for at-risk youth as well as Title I funds. The extra staffing provides students with significant face-to-face support on an as-needed basis as they work through their online lessons.Besides the four online core courses, the students attend two elective courses. These take place in a traditional classroom with one teacher at the front of the class and 30 to 34 students.Grand Rapids modeled its content strategy for the core classes after that of Michigan’s nearby Kent Intermediate School District, which had engaged in a rigorous selection process and elected to license e2020 content. For some core classes, the Centers of Innovation also use NovaNet, which is already a fixture of the district’s alternative education program. As students work in the computer lab, the e2020 and NovaNet software assess their performance in real time. This allows the four roving adults to catch problems quickly and offer face-to-face intervention.Grand Rapids uses Total Recall for the student information system, although it began migrating to PowerSchool during the 2010–11 school year. The intention is to integrate PowerSchool and e2020, while still using some customized programming in Total Recall.Students complete most online core coursework at school, although they can occasionally work on some assignments at home if they have computer access. Students work at an individualized pace and can move forward only when they demonstrate at least 70 percent proficiency. Teachers use Gradebook to keep track of student grades and assignments. Parents can access these records through Gradebook’s parent portal.Notable results  Initial test results at the Centers of Innovation indicate that participating 9th graders on average outperformed all other students in traditional high schools in the district. Anecdotal evidence suggests that teachers have been pleased with the blended program. Special education teachers in particular claim that the hybridization is much more effective for their students on a whole.On the horizon  Grand Rapids has extended its foray into blended learning for the 2010–11 school year to all comprehensive high schools, where all 9th-grade math and social studies courses (plus an introductory science course at one high school) are experimenting with a rotation model of blended learning. Instead of offering four out of six classes online each day, the new model features a rotation between online and face-to-face learning within each course. In this model, the high schools allocate Day 1 for 100 percent traditional teaching, so that teachers can introduce concepts in a lecture style to a classroom of 30 to 34 students. On Day 2, students work online in computer labs with four adults, including a teacher, special education instructor, paraprofessional, and tutor. They use e2020, Moodle, HippoCampus, and other website content to reinforce the materials they learned on Mondays. On Day 3, students work partly online, but also spend time presenting their findings to their peers. This cycle then repeats.District superintendent Bernard Taylor recently announced that this rotation may change from three days to two to give teachers more time for direct instruction.Michigan State University and the University of Pittsburgh have agreed to advise and audit the new rotation-model program at the comprehensive high schools.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Some attend all 5 days. Students use K12, Inc.’s online program as the basis for their remote and on-site learning.Program backgroundHistory and context  Jeff Piontek began his career in education as a science teacher in the South Bronx. He later became a staff developer and then a district director. Eventually he worked for the chancellor of New York City Public Schools as the director of instructional and informational technology. Toward the end of that tenure, he authored Blogs, Wikis, and Podcasts, Oh My!: Electronic Media in the Classroom, a book about how to adapt writing skills to modern communication tools.Armed with broad expertise about technology in the classroom, Piontek took a position with K12, Inc. to open a new K12, Inc.-powered charter school in Hawaii that would blend online learning with face-to-face instruction.Hawaii Technology Academy (HTA) opened for the 2008–09 school year with an office in Kapolei on the island of Oahu. Within the first year, 250 students were enrolled (grades K–10) and a learning center opened in Waipahu. The following year, enrollment doubled to 500 students. During the 2010–11 school year, HTA enrolled 1,000 students and had to turn away 880 more because of an enrollment cap mandated in its charter with the state. The State of Hawaii Charter School Administrative Office has since removed the cap beginning with the 2011–12 school year.Enrollment in HTA is available to Hawaii residents of the islands of Oahu, Kauai, Maui, Lanai, Molokai, and the Big Island. HTA only has learning centers on the island of Oahu and Kauai, however. Students on the other islands must attend HTA as full-time virtual students, with occasional synchronous videoconferences or face-to-face meetings with their teachers. For the 2010–11 school year, 710 enrollees resided on Oahu. The other 290 lived on neighboring islands.Blended model  HTA’s mission is to use research-based technology applications and meaningful teacher, student, and parent involvement to provide an innovative blended model of public charter school education adapted to the needs of elementary, middle, and high school students who reside in Hawaii.Roughly 20 percent of HTA students attend on a virtual basis, except for a weekly visit to the learning center (for those within geographic proximity), where they rotate to face-to-face delivery. They must maintain at least a C+ average to remain on this schedule.On the other end of the spectrum, roughly 20 percent of students attend the brick-and-mortar learning center in Waipahu five days a week. Twelve percent of these students are special education students. These students rotate between online learning and face-to-face instruction while at the centers.The remaining 60 percent rotate more evenly between on-site learning at one of the two learning centers and online learning at home. The learning centers are open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays. Every Monday morning, the on-site teachers review data reports of student progress and notify their students of when they need to attend the center for additional tutoring or remediation. These students spend an average of three to five hours doing K12, Inc. curriculum per off-site day, and a minimum of one day of instruction on-site. During the face-to-face instruction, teachers provide help and reinforcement with challenging material.During the remote portion of instruction, students use the K12, Inc. online platform and content. In addition, K12, Inc. ships each family boxes of materials, including textbooks, videos, and other hands-on tools and resources. These materials complement the online elements of the program. The teachers at the learning center provide virtual office hours, often in the evenings, to help students who are working remotely. HTA uses uBoost to award students points for progressing with their work, and school personnel report that this program has been very motivating.All students with access to the Oahu or Kauai learning center must attend a center at least once a week. Students in grades K–2 must also attend a mandatory writing class every week. In grades 4, 7, and 9, students must take the Hawaii State History course on-site as well as participate in field experiences.HTA offers digital media, hula and other dance, ukulele, robotics, environmental, and a variety of other optional face-to-face activities and clubs. HTA also provides frequent field trips. HTA students are approved by the Hawaii High School Athletic Association to play for sports teams at their local public school.HTA employs 30 teachers, which equates to a student-to-teacher ratio of 33-to-1, although many HTA teachers work part-time. State law requires that all HTA on-site staff be state employees, which means that all staff members also belong to a union.Notable results  Piontek said that the HTA model has worked especially well for certain students, including aspiring ballerinas, professional surfers, and performers on TV shows, who have taken advantage of HTA’s flexible scheduling.During its first year, HTA had the second highest test scores among charter schools in the state. Eighty percent of students passed the reading portion and 60 percent passed math. School leaders are exploring ways to improve these results.On the horizon  Many Hawaii parents want to codify a seat-time requirement to prevent the state from implementing teacher furlough days to deal with budget shortfalls, as occurred in 2009–10. They want to mandate that students attend class at least 200 days per year. If this petition is successful, HTA will be challenged to continue with its on-site, off-site rotation model. Piontek is advocating for a competency-based policy rather than a new seat-time mandate.In terms of a technology wish list, Piontek said that the process of exporting K12, Inc. data to Hawaii’s student information system is time consuming. Currently, Hawaii does not have a comprehensive data system and HTA administrators have to enter student data individually.HTA is considering scaling the model to other locations.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

In late 1998 they decided to start a charter school and named Larry Rosenstock, then president of Price Charities and a past high school principal, as its founding principal.Today High Tech High operates 11 charter schools in the San Diego and Chula Vista, Calif. area, including two elementary schools, four middle schools, and five high schools. It grounds its schools in a philosophy of personalization, adult-world connection, common intellectual mission, and teacher-as-designer. The school admits students using a zipcode based lottery, which results in a mix of socioeconomic backgrounds among its students.High Tech High integrates technical and academic education to prepare students for college in both the high-tech and liberal arts fields. Its constructivist philosophy translates into an emphasis on group reflection, collaboration among learners, and the relationship between teacher and student in the learning process.High Tech High also runs the High Tech High Graduate School of Education (GSE) to provide professional development and teacher credentialing embedded within its village of schools. SGE students learn and work alongside the K–12 teachers, administrators, and students.Blended model  Because of its constructivist bent, school leaders have been cautious about embracing online learning. The school has long emphasized and prioritized synchronous learning, where students, the teacher, and the material interact together. “Online feels like a textbook screen,” Rosenstock said. “It’s mostly done independently, often asynchronously, and it doesn’t help students learn to work collaboratively.” High Tech High does use Elluminate Live! for some experiences, but most interactions are face-to-face.School leaders have found, however, that blended learning meets its needs in specific and limited ways. Almost all students in grades 6 to 12 use the ALEKS program, an artificially intelligent assessment and learning system, to supplement mathematics instruction. The teachers using ALEKS divide their classrooms into two groups and provide face-to-face instruction for half the group while the other half works on ALEKS. The two classrooms with the highest gains in math scores in 2009 to 2010 both participated in this blended program.School leaders decided to use ALEKS because their students’ math scores on the state test were not as exceptional as they wanted. They thought the computer software could help students “drill and kill” math problems. Ben Daley, chief operations officer at High Tech High, reported that the ALEKS program has been very popular with both kids and teachers so far.High Tech High also has begun to use Rosetta Stone to teach foreign languages. They say that research shows students learn more in a year with Rosetta Stone than with even the best face-to-face foreign language teachers. “Rosetta Stone has spent millions in research and development, and it has a very clever way of interacting with its users,” Rosenstock said.Rosenstock and Daley are especially reluctant to use online programs for writing instruction. “Programs like WriteToLearn may help students learn things like punctuation,” said Rosenstock, “but how does it help kids learn how to really write?”Notable results  As of 2010, 100 percent of High Tech High graduates were accepted to college, and over 99 percent intended to begin college in the fall after graduation. Over 93 percent of High Tech High students passed the California High School Exit Exam (CAHSSE) on their first attempt compared to 80 percent of students statewide.On the horizon  School leaders are open-minded about using technology in the future, provided that it helps them better serve their students. For example, Rosenstock and Daley are interested in a web conferencing program that could allow a 25-student classroom to interact more compellingly, so that students can see each other and feel connected to each other, even when working in a virtual environment. They also envision a platform like Amazon.com for education, which would serve as a central dispatching place to share and select assets for online classes.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

One of its increasingly popular options is the two-day hybrid, where students rotate between online learning from a remote location for about half the time and on-site, face-to-face instruction for the other half. In 2007 it partnered with Ball State University to create its first school of this type. Hoosier Academies is a public charter school with a learning center in Indianapolis, which serves students in grades K–11, and in Muncie, Ind., which serves students in grades K–8.Blended model  Students at the Hoosier Academies attend a brick-and-mortar school two days a week. There, they meet with certified teachers who provide tutoring, face-to-face remediation, and other on-site learning experiences. They also engage in extracurricular activities if they wish, such as clubs and sports.The students rotate to their homes or another off-site location to complete K12, Inc.’s online curriculum on their own for the rest of the week. Their face-to-face teachers are available online and by phone to answer their questions. The model requires common pacing to ensure that students are at the same place in their learning when they rotate to the traditional classroom twice a week. For young learners, an actively engaged adult at home is essential.Hoosier Academies’ teachers can serve approximately 50 students each, two cohorts of students at a time.Notable results  Hoosier Academies students at the Indianapolis Learning Center performed slightly lower than the state average on the state standardized test in 2009–10. They scored one percentage point lower than the state average in English/language arts and just under seven percentage points lower in math.Hoosier Academies grew its student enrollment in 2010–11. Over 50 percent of students who attended the Indianapolis Learning Center in 2010–11 were new students for that school year. These students came from a variety of previous school settings.Hoosier Academies has been able to operate with public revenue of $5,800 per student at the Indianapolis Learning Center and $6,200 in Muncie. According to Hoosier Academies officials, Indiana spends between $6,300 and $6,800 on average per student across the state.The school realizes efficiencies in its use of real estate, as it can serve two cohorts of students at a time. It also saves in personnel costs, particularly in administrative costs, because K12, Inc. manages much of the administrative burden for the school.On the horizon  Ron Packard, CEO of K12, Inc., said that K12 is working collaboratively with other charter school partners and school districts to set up different part-time online models that do not require common pacing, such as the model that the San Francisco Flex Academy is piloting (see the “Flex Public Schools” profile).Packard also said that a recent K12, Inc. study showed that even when schools use K12, Inc. curriculum as an online textbook but preserve the traditional classroom structure, they realize significant leaps in academic progress. “In seven out of seven implementations, we have been successful [in improving test results],” he said. Packard believes that using K12, Inc. curriculum improves teacher effectiveness and student engagement, both in blended and traditional environments.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Roughly 47,000 students attend one of the 53 Jesuit schools in the United States.Jesuit schools have a strong sense of mission, as well as a sizable group of people who are committed to it. Through his work in a Jesuit school, Jeff Hausman recognized the potential impact of tapping into this tight culture to build a user network for online learning among Jesuit schools. To do this, he and a colleague set up the nonprofit Jesuit Virtual Learning Academy, based in Omaha, Neb. The focus of the Jesuit Virtual Learning Academy is threefold: to provide (1) credit bearing coursework; (2) online faculty development; and (3) a technology platform that encourages communication and collaboration among Jesuit schools. Twenty-one of the U.S. Jesuit schools now take advantage of academy programs.Blended model  Each of the 21 participating schools offers up to 20 online courses to their students as a way to expand their course catalogs. The Jesuit schools purchase this content by paying a membership fee to the Jesuit Virtual Learning Academy. This academy, in turn, hires traditional Jesuit teachers to backward design their courses onto the open-source, Web-based Moodle course platform and then teach the courses online. Online teachers use discussion boards, group activities, and other modalities to engage their students. The virtual academy reports final grades back to the Jesuit school, but it does not track other student performance data or adapt the content pursuant to student performance.Academy courses are traditional online classes designed primarily for anytime, anywhere access. Teachers use real-time presentation and discussion tools to add additional value to the primarily asynchronous learning environment. The academy provides rarer subjects such as Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, AP Music Theory, AP Macroeconomics, and others. By focusing on non-traditional courses that are not currently available face-to-face at the schools, Jesuit Virtual Learning Academy minimizes resistance from teachers and parents.Many of the Jesuit schools also purchase online professional development courses from the Jesuit Virtual Learning Academy. These six-week courses take advantage of the variable use of time that the online environment affords. Courses attempt to incorporate many of the best practices in adult learning, including the use of professional learning communities to allow teachers to benefit from each other’s experiences.Notable results  Jesuit Virtual Learning Academy completed its first full cycle of coursework at the end of the 2009–10 a. Though the sample size of baseline data from that first complete year was small, Hausman said that the AP test results and user satisfaction surveys (by students, faculty, and schools) were encouraging.On the horizon  Hausman said that Jesuit Virtual Learning Academy’s ultimate value proposition lies in matching the collaborative nature of the Jesuit network of schools with the equally collaborative nature of new technologies to bring new learning resources into the traditional classroom. Using simple, low-cost technologies, the academy already has in place classroom-to-classroom learning experiences involving Jesuit schoolteachers and students from the United States, Poland, and India.To better support its collaborative community, the academy recently launched a platform that seeks to make order of the myriad Internet-based teaching tools in existence by cataloging them and allowing teachers to share, rate, and discuss resources found on the Internet.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Also, students supplement by taking online courses remotely. Rotation: For pilot, students learn three days face-to-face and two days in a computer lab. Rotation: For hybrid grants, teacher chooses own pattern of rotating between online and face-to-face learning.Program backgroundHistory and context  State officials in Kentucky anticipated the potential for online learning over a decade ago, and first opened the virtual doors for school in 2000 with the establishment of Kentucky Virtual High School (KVHS), which they designed to offer a range of online, e-learning services for schools and teachers—anywhere, anytime. They integrated KVHS’s resources with district programs to provide access to an expanded curriculum, AP and foreign language courses, options for credit recovery, and support for specific needs, including gifted and at-risk students. The state later folded KVHS into Kentucky Virtual Schools, a state-run online-learning organization that became the parent organization for both KVHS and e-Learning Kentucky, a professional development program for educators.A few years after KVHS got its start, the Appalachia Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) and the Collaborative for Teaching and Learning (CTL) asked state officials about other applications for online learning beyond the purely virtual program. In January 2007, the Kentucky Department of Education, REL, and CTL launched the Hybrid Algebra I Research Project (pilot), a study to measure the effectiveness of four cohorts of high school students engaged in a blended curriculum for Algebra I. The state also launched the Hybrid-Learning Grant Program (hybrid grants) in 2009 to fund individual teachers who wanted to experiment with their own blended models, in exchange for sharing results with the state.Blended model Kentucky Virtual High School KVHS supports schools and districts in Kentucky by offering access to courses that brick-and-mortar schools cannot accommodate. In the 2009–10 school year, KVHS delivered roughly 1,200 enrollments to 800 students each semester. The leadership team that launched KVHS chose Blackboard for the learning management system because KVHS was able to join a statewide contract between Blackboard and public universities in the state.KVHS has developed some of its own courses, but it also uses NROC, APEX Learning, Aventa Learning, and the Florida Virtual School. The KVHS staff and teachers analyze courses every year to determine which best meet the needs of students based on such factors as quality of assessments, reading level of content, developmental appropriateness of content, and how engaging the course is for students. KVHS reports assessment and transcript data to each student’s home school, which uploads it into its student information system.Approximately 40 Kentucky-certified teachers serve as the online teachers for KVHS courses. Teachers use Wimba products to communicate with students, along with the typical discussion boards, emails, and phone calls. Teachers are not limited to these tools alone and many use additional communication tools. Over the years, KVHS teachers have also created courses, served as content experts for third-party courses, reviewed newly developed courses, served as mentors for new teachers, and contributed in many other ways to the success of KVHS.Because it is designed as a support for schools and districts, KVHS allows any number of methods of student enrollment. Some students attend public school, while others are part of independent schools or are homeschooled. Some students take courses in a computer lab as part of their regular school day, whereas others self-blend from a remote location. Students can enroll in a school that has almost its entire catalog of courses from KHVS; participate in just one class that is not available at their home school; or take several KVHS courses at night to get ahead.The schedule aligns with the traditional school calendar; the fall session runs August through December, and the spring session runs from January through May. Students who want to self-blend are responsible for the $330-per-full-credit fee, although the state does offer need-based scholarships for AP courses. When districts use KVHS courses to provide for an entire classroom in an online-lab environment, the districts cover these fees for the students. Most of the courses rely on online materials instead of textbooks, but several require students or schools to purchase supplementary hard-copy texts and materials. The state negotiates to allow cheaper course fees for schools that use a KVHS course for a large number of students, such as to replace a full-time classroom teacher.Pilot In January 2007, the Kentucky Department of Education launched a pilot study with 42 schools, including 60 teachers and 8,000 students. They partnered with CTL and REL to study the outcomes of the pilot. The project followed four cohorts of students for four years to see how they performed after having learned Algebra I in a blended classroom. To prepare for the study, participating teachers dedicated a summer to professional development and participated in monthly trainings.Students in the blended Algebra I course spent three days with a face-to-face teacher, and then two days in the computer lab, where the same teacher changed roles from an instructor to a coach by helping students from the sidelines as the students learned online. No additional adults were staffed in either the traditional classroom or computer labs.The study relied on NROC for content because it was free and the researchers considered it high quality. They used Blackboard as the learning management system.Hybrid grants In 2009 the Kentucky Department of Education began offering grants to teachers to support their experimentation with blended learning. The department provided approved teachers a free blended course shell, including the Blackboard learning management system, a license to Wimba for classroom webinars, content from NROC pre-loaded into the courseware, enough seat licenses for their classrooms, and three weeks of professional development. In exchange, teachers could use the shell to build a blended course for up to 30 students, provided that they committed to the following: Complete a three-week blended design training during the summer Engage the class in online learning at least once per week first semester, and twice per week second semester Administer a pre- and post-test to their class, as well as to a comparable class not participating in the grant program Participate in an online discussion group to share data and strategies Administer an end-of-the-unit student opinion surveySubmit an exemplary blended unit of study, including samples of student workIn 2009–10 the Kentucky Department of Education awarded grants to 16 teachers, who each conducted his or her own micro-trials. Projects varied from core curriculum to liberal arts to health sciences. The majority of teachers used blending to differentiate learning and to provide additional support for struggling students. Some reported that the format helped them meet the needs of each student better than in a traditional classroom setting.Notable results  Enrollments at KVHS have remained steady at the 1,200 enrollments-per-semester range. KVHS has been instrumental in helping districts avoid paying for a traditional teacher in cases when class enrollments are small. One district is using KVHS to deliver all Spanish I and II coursework for the 186 students interested in those courses. This has replaced the cost of two full-time traditional teachers, although the district must still pay a reduced-priced, per-student fee to KVHS. KVHS has historically had a successful completion rate above 75 percent, with a high of 82 percent in 2009–10.Results for the pilot are not yet available.Findings from the hybrid grants are qualitative in nature. Teacher-reported data shows an increase in student and parent satisfaction. Teachers said the program provided a positive way of giving intervention and extra support to low performing students, allowed students to take responsibility for their own learning, prepared students for college experiences, and addressed the need for different learning styles.On the horizon  Kiley Whitaker and David Couch, Kentucky Department of Education officials who work with technology and virtual learning, said that the top need in Kentucky related to virtual learning is for the government to offer free tuition for KVHS courses, so that students who want to self-blend do not have to pay per-course fees. They believe that this would greatly expand participation in KVHS courses.Kentucky is exploring how to expand blended learning to solve the problem of students missing school for short stints, such as during snow days and flu epidemics. Currently about 20 percent of Kentucky students do not have high-speed connectivity in their homes. Twenty schools in the state also lack high-speed Internet access. Whitaker and Couch say that the state needs dynamic leadership to bring together the federal funds and private companies necessary to extend connectivity to all parts of the state.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Its first two schools, KIPP Los Angeles College Prep and KIPP Academy of Opportunity, opened in the summer of 2003.The mission of KIPP LA is to teach the academic skills, foster the intellectual habits, and cultivate the character traits needed for students to thrive in high school, college, and life.In the fall of 2010, KIPP LA opened KIPP Empower Academy (KIPP Empower) serving kindergarten students (ultimately grades K–4) in South Los Angeles. KIPP Empower is the first school in the KIPP network to use a blended-school model. This decision to innovate on the traditional KIPP model was in reaction to cuts in already low public funding as a result of California’s budget crisis. In total, KIPP Empower lost $200,000 of planned public funding at the time.Blended model  At KIPP Empower, blended learning occurs within the core academic classroom. In its first year, the school has four classes, each serving 28 or 29 students. Each classroom is equipped with 15 computers. Throughout the day the teacher rotates students among the computers, small-group instruction, and individualized instruction. During teacher-led instruction, group size is under 14 students per group for reading, math, writing, and science. Students on the computer use iStation, Compass Learning, Learning.com, Study Island, and other adaptive learning programs. KIPP Empower’s leaders believe that this adaptive-technology approach, coupled with enhanced individualized attention from the classroom teacher, will result in academic results equal to or greater than those of the traditional KIPP model.KIPP Empower is working with Anthony Kim of EdElements to develop a learning platform that will enable the following: (1) single sign-on capability for students and teachers; (2) efficient administration of online learning; and (3) actionable reporting of online learning data that can be used by teachers to inform future individualization.Traditional KIPP LA elementary schools have student-to-teacher ratios of 20-to-1. Through its blended-learning model, KIPP Empower is able to increase this ratio by eight students and eliminate one classroom, resulting in additional revenue of $140,000 and reduced expenses of $100,000.Notable results  KIPP Empower is in its first year of operations, but has begun to experience promising results. At the start of the school year, only 9 percent of students tested as proficient or advanced on the STEP Literacy Assessment. Halfway through the year, 78 percent scored proficient or advanced. KIPP LA will make future results available as the program continues.On the horizon  By 2012, KIPP LA plans to increase from five to seven schools and from 1,300 to 1,750 students served. After this phase of growth, the organization plans to open seven additional schools to reach a total of 14 schools servings 6,000 students.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Dr. Louise Bay Waters, CEO of LPS, has spent her 35-year career focusing on how to accelerate achievement among the lowest-performing urban students and close the achievement gap. The students at Leadership Public Schools are 79 percent free and reduced lunch, and almost all who attend college will be the first in their families to do so. Almost half of ninth graders enter LPS below the 5th-grade reading level. Thirty-six percent are English-language learners. Waters and her team have struggled with how best to accelerate learning for this demographic, particularly because the organization’s mandate is to prepare 100 percent of its students for college by ensuring that all students take a college prep curriculum.Blended model  Initially, LPS experimented with blending by sending struggling students to computer labs for online-learning interventions. Waters and her team used K12, Inc., Cyber High, Brigham Young University, and other providers to deliver various courses. They concluded, however, that in general, online learning did not work for her schools. In most cases, paying for an online teacher in addition to an adult supervisor in the computer labs, plus the cost of the content, was more expensive than paying for a traditional teacher alone. In addition, online programs were usually text heavy and required a level of independent learning ability that was impossible for most of the students.Instead, Waters and her team decided that the most promising technology opportunity for their students was the growing adaptability of digital content. They reasoned that by using customizable digital textbooks, they could offer literacy support customized to each band of student, including those at or above grade level, those who struggled with English, and those with major learning gaps. Waters decided to reach out to CK–12, which provided standards-based, mass-customization, online textbooks (flexbooks). CK–12 and LPS agreed to partner to develop and deliver a new generation of custom flexbooks called “College Access Readers.” LPS began deploying these College Access Readers across its classrooms in the fall of 2010. By 2012, it intends to provide the readers for all subjects, customized for all bands of student ability.Teachers use College Access Readers to support and enrich their traditional classroom model. They display content from the readers using LCD projectors or printouts. Ideally, each student will someday have a digital device to allow individual access to the content.Thus, most aspects of the LPS model are not blended, as defined in this report, because they lack a self-paced online learning component. LPS does plan to use College Access Readers as self-paced online learning vehicles for subsets of its population, including students who are absent (there are high numbers of pregnant teens), those needing credit recovery, and special education and ESL students who will use online text-to-speech English-Spanish versions of the readers.LPS provides an important illustration of when online blending has been successful only in meeting the needs of a small fraction of the population in a given demographic.Notable results  LPS does not have specific results for the small segment of its population using online learning for unit recovery, special education, or ESL interventions. Its College Access Readers deployment, which does not constitute online blended learning as defined in this report, is still too early to produce performance results. Foundation grants are subsidizing deployment of the readers, although the cost of the readers is offset by CK–12’s provision of free online textbook content.On the horizon  Waters intends to expand and scale the College Access Readers quickly across her member schools. Within two years she hopes to have one-to-one laptops that will allow the readers to be used online. She is interested in using online courses if she can locate some that she feels are appropriate for her students and at a cost that is lower than hiring traditional teachers.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Its founder, Sajan George, was the former managing director of the national education practice for Alvarez & Marsal, a global professional services firm that specializes in corporate restructuring. George created Matchbook Learning and its blended model in 2011 in response to an emerging market need for school districts to partner with education management organizations to assist the more than 5,000 “turnaround” schools in the United States—the bottom five percent of U.S. schools. The number of turaround schools is expected to exceed 12,000 by 2015. “Despite the market need, there are very few turnaround models that are scalable and even fewer hybrid school models that are being applied to this turnaround need,” said George.Matchbook Learning is launching an effort to change the fundamental strategy behind school turnarounds. George reasons that charter schools generally rely on the human capital strategy of “a great teacher in every classroom,” but that this strategy is not scalable. For example, although Race to the Top funds are available to encourage states to attend to the bottom five percent of schools, these schools traditionally have not had any way to access a sufficient number of superstar teachers to generate sustainable transformation.This huge market need, combined with the push from the federal government through Race to the Top funds, sparked George’s interest in formulating a novel turnaround strategy based on online-learning technology, rather than on human capital. George designed Matchbook Learning to partner with a range of the most promising online education providers to form this new solution and access this burgeoning market.Blended model  The starting theory for Matchbox Learning’s blended solution stems from the notion that poorly performing schools do not need to replace their teachers, but redefine the teacher role. Matchbook Learning plans to equip each student in its blended schools with a netbook and wireless connection. It will use a learning management system and online teachers to move the students through content, plan lessons and assignments, grade work, provide daily assessments, and deliver summative assessments. The on-site teacher’s role shifts radically from presumable content expert to individual coach. The online platform provides a printout every day to report how each student is progressing and identify how the on-site coach should best provide support. The coach offers ad hoc nurturing and intervention, as well as classroom instruction.Matchbook Learning plans to use federal School Improvement Grants and Race to the Top funds for start-up costs that will include netbooks and other supplies and infrastructure. George expects that traditional per-pupil spending at urban, high-poverty schools, however, will be sufficient to sustain Matchbox Learning schools beyond the start-up phase. The model indicates a cost per pupil of $9,000 to $10,000, which assumes that Matchbook Learning provides a full takeover, but it is discounted if the company does not assume all of the costs of running the brick-and-mortar school. This is based on a 1-to-30 on-site-teacher-to-student ratio and a 1-to-60 virtual-teacher-to-student ratio, which nets out at a 1-to-20 teacher-to-student ratio effectively. George has a background in transformational cost cutting across numerous urban public school districts, including New York City, New Orleans, Washington, DC, Detroit, St. Louis, and Providence, R.I. He expects that he will continue to find significant cost efficiencies by reducing extra staff, absenteeism/substitute teachers, and textbook costs, as well as improving professional development, teacher recruitment, and other operations.Matchbox Learning schools will retain all standard physical constructs that they already have in place, such as art programs, physical education, and sports. George believes, however, that many supplementary programs, such as after-school tutoring and summer school can be reduced or even eliminated as schools learn to make their regular programming work better, instead of relying on supplemental programming to fill the holes.Matchbook Learning, LLC has formed two partnerships to deliver its model:Connections Academy will supply the learning management system, all courses and content, virtual teachers, virtual principals, and professional development for their own virtual staff.Wireless Generation will provide a system that translates data from the learning management system into customizable printouts for the on-site coaches. These reports segment the class according to which students most need face-to-face intervention and how, using a simple red-yellow-green color code. Wireless Generation will provide initial professional development for the on-site coaches and principal to train them in their new roles, and then continue to work with them to develop their skills. On-site coaches and online teachers will discuss student needs together each week.Matchbook Learning will be the architect behind the model and the main contractor for any turnaround contracts. It will recruit principals, implement the systems, and oversee the execution. They will also attend to operational details, such as bussing, security, facilities, and maintenance.Notable results  Results are not yet available for this program.George says that cost alone is not the right metric when evaluating school turnarounds. He prefers to think about cost per successful graduate, and then minimize that ratio as much as possible by increasing the denominator.On the horizon  Matchbook Learning has been pre-approved so far in Kentucky, Michigan, Washington, and Tennessee as whole school turnaround partners. It is also in conversations with several major urban school districts around the country. Its founders hope to launch by fall of 2011. They are currently responding to proposal requests from states and districts that want a scalable solution for school turnarounds.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Register allocated $1.5 million in Race-to-the-Top funds to outfit more Nashville classrooms with high-speed-connected computers and to design the online-learning program.The purpose of the online program was three-fold: (1) to allow students to enroll full-time in a district virtual school; (2) to provide online courses and online teachers for schools to use in place of face-to-face teachers; and (3) to expand course offerings for individual students who wanted to self-blend.Ray began by forming a team of advisers, including Cathy Cavanaugh from the University of Florida; Chris Dede from the Harvard Graduate School of Education; John Ross, a consultant to the U.S. Department of Technology; and Kathy Hayden from California State University, San Marcos. The team began convening each month in virtual meetings to design Metropolitan Nashville’s approach.Blended model  The vision for the district’s online program was to create a catalog of online courses, which students could take in a computer lab or classroom on campus with a virtual teacher, or from home for credit recovery or credit advancement. An available adult would supervise the online learning completed on campus, but not provide subject-matter expertise. For example, a school could use the district’s program to offer Chinese to a classroom of students for whom no face-to-face Chinese teacher was available. Likewise, if several students in a statistics class wanted to take AP statistics but the teacher only was able to teach basic statistics, that group could take the AP course in one half of the classroom while the rest of the class learned in a traditional format. Students could also take courses remotely, either full-time or on a supplemental basis. Ray and Register believed an online option would afford their schools and students tremendous flexibility.The district’s program would serve students in grades 7 to 12. “Kids need to be old enough to be successful,” Ray said. “They need a certain internal mechanism rolling. I like to think of it as an ability to beat a video game.”The first phase of the project was to select a third party to deliver online content. The district did not plan to modify or customize content, at least in the initial stages of implementation. Ray selected two district personnel to serve as content specialists. They issued a request for proposals, received bids from several providers, and ultimately decided to contract with both Aventa Learning and Pearson. They also decided to use Blackboard for the learning management system because the district already had a contract with Blackboard Connect, a mass notification system that sent alerts to parents and students. District leaders wanted the two systems to be integrated.The second phase of the project was to create instructional supports to help each student succeed. This included setting up a 24/7 tutoring program via videoconferencing, an online virtual library using the district’s own physical libraries, and counseling via chat, telephone, and videoconferencing. They trained school counselors to help gauge when students should be in online courses. The district began to set up a training department in instructional design because it hoped to use its own teachers eventually as the online teachers rather than outsourcing this job to the content providers.Ray planned to use Discovery Education Assessment to deliver short-cycle assessments for math and English, because she liked the vendor’s ability to translate assessment results into individual plans for improvement.Notable results  The district launched its full online program beginning with the 2010–11 school year, and results are still not available. The program accommodated roughly 500 enrollments in its first year.Ray believes the district’s program eventually will provide significant cost savings. With online learning, 25 students can be learning 25 different subjects in the same room with only one on-the-ground adult. She believes savings will come from reduced personnel and textbook costs and improved square footage efficiencies.On the horizon  Ray would like future legislation to redesign the funding formula to better facilitate digital learning. Specifically, she would like to see funding follow a student in whatever learning environment the student is in. The program that provides the course gets paid. Funding should mirror the college formula, where schools think in terms of hourly costs per student instead of daily costs, she said.Ray would like to rethink the payment of teachers, too, and have greater flexibility to differentiate contracts for online and on-site teachers. She believes that online teachers need specialized credentials to evidence their training in delivering online instruction.Her technology wish list includes more immersive technologies to allow students to touch and move virtual objects and experience them spatially. She believes this would especially enhance math and science learning. She also wants more mobile technologies. “The Internet is a tethering device,” she said. “Students need to be able to access the Internet in a more fluid way, so they can sit in a park, for example.” She believes the iPad will change the way people teach, and that in the future, many teachers and students will depend on handheld mobile devices with a large enough viewing area. She also sees an eventual migration to protected cloud computing.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Two years later, the legislature funded the Michigan Virtual School (MVS) as a division of MVU to provide access to broader course content through online learning for middle and high school students in the state. The MVS program focused on expanding access for special needs students, credit recovery, home-schooled students, public and non-public school students, and gifted and talented students who wanted advanced courses.MVU’s role has evolved over the years. In its early days, it served primarily as a change agent. Most schools in Michigan were not asking for the creation of a statewide virtual school at the time, nor did many educators view online learning as a priority for public education. Michigan Virtual University introduced Michigan school districts to online learning and helped create a new awareness. After being in operation for four to five years, MVU began to take on the role of service provider. This role focused on providing high quality instructor-led online courses at affordable rates. During this time, MVS became a key part of MVU’s program. In recent years, a new role centered on teacher development began to emerge for MVU.Blended model  Like other virtual schools that offer a la carte online courses, MVS can be the backbone behind several blended-learning models. For example, Cornerstone Charter Schools is contracting with MVS to provide online content and teachers for its new high school, which will operate with a flex model (see the “Cornerstone Health High School” profile). Other operators could contract with MVS to deliver courses in an online-lab, online-driver model, or other setup.The majority of MVS students, however, experience MVS through the self-blend model. These students take MVS courses from a remote location while attending a traditional middle or high school for their other courses. Most have a district mentor who meets with them at least once face-to-face and helps monitor progress. The mentor has access to the learning management system and can communicate directly with the online teacher.MVS provides the option of three course styles for students who want to self-blend:Instructor-led courses These courses are held in a virtual environment, yet mirror the student experience in a traditional classroom. The format uses the Blackboard learning management system to create an online learning environment for students. A Michigan-certified online teacher provides the lesson plan, direction, content, and feedback for the students. She makes assignments, leads threaded discussions, grades student work, sets deadlines, and administers assessments.The online teacher also helps personalize the learning for each student and monitors each student’s progress. Students use chat rooms, email, threaded discussions, and podcasts to communicate with their teacher. These courses have a flexible admission date, but a fixed completion date.The cost for these courses ranges from $220 to $275 per seat.Instructor-less courses For highly independent learners, MVS offers several online educational products and services that can be used by students with no instructor involvement. The products work best for students who require little guidance or outside motivation and who want to self-pace completely. Each course offers 70 to 90 hours of interactive direct instruction, guided practice, and integrated formative, summative, and diagnostic assessment. The courses include targeted scaffolding for students who benefit from additional learning.Apex Learning provides the content for these courses. The cost per seat is $89.Instructor-supported courses MVS recently began piloting a third option, instructor-facilitated courses, in which online teachers are available to answer questions, but assignments and assessments are auto scored. The online teacher works with one or more students to provide coach-like assistance with their online course or learning activities and ensure that students are making progress. These courses are less expensive than instructor-led courses and are geared toward higher achieving students who are able to self-direct their learning. Jamey Fitzpatrick, CEO of MVU, referred to this approach as the “academic help-desk” model.Still in testing phase, this course style is available for the following subjects: Algebra I, Geometry, Biology, English 9, and English 10.The consortium price is $190 per seat; the non-consortium price is $210 per seat.MVS develops much of its own content and also licenses from various third parties. It has experimented with several partnerships, such as a deal with the Baseball Hall of Fame in New York to co-build a math statistics course. Courses reside in the Blackboard learning management system that MVU houses in its data center. The total public support for MVS during the 2010–11 school year totals $2.5 million, which translates to $166.67 per enrollment.Notable results  The average course completion rate in 2008–09 for all MVS courses was 81 percent. Data for 2009–10 suggests that the completion rate has climbed to 84 percent. MVS offers more than 150 courses, including courses in oceanography, forensic science, and Mandarin Chinese.MVU is studying possible financial efficiencies through its pilot model, which seeks to maintain academic performance while lowering teacher involvement. Fitzpatrick expects, however, that this model will only work for high achieving students.On the horizon  Fitzpatrick envisions much of MVU’s future impact to come not just from MVS, but also from its involvement with teacher training. To date MVU has trained over 500 teachers to deliver online learning. MVU is piloting an Online Teaching and Learning Mastery Program that uses project-based learning to offer K–12 teachers the opportunity to create online activities and entire online courses. The year-long course allows teachers to study online teaching and then make products either individually or collaboratively that they can use in their classrooms.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

The Foundation partnered with Katie Salen, executive director of the Institute of Play, a nonprofit that applies the principles of game development outside the world of commercial gaming, and with New Visions for Public Schools, an education reform organization in New York City. Together, this partnership created the design for Quest to Learn (Q2L), a school that opened its doors to its first class in the fall of 2009 with 76 sixth graders. The school began adding a subsequent grade each year after 2009.The idea behind Q2L is to engage students from a diversity of backgrounds through game-like learning, which draws on the intrinsic qualities of games and their design to engage students in a deep exploration of academic subject matter. The founding team hopes that this design will create a framework that motivates and engages urban students, who are all too often disconnected and alienated from traditional brick-and-mortar comprehensive high schools.Q2L grew from a design methodology focused on creating engaging, content-rich and standards-based, youth-centered learning environments. The learning model developed by the Institute of Play applies to all aspects of the school, including an innovative professional development program called Studio Q, a closed social network platform called Being Me, the curriculum, and overall approach to school culture. The model is highly collaborative, pairing game designers with teachers and curriculum specialists and integrating digital media, including games, alongside more traditional tools like textbooks, worksheets, and pencils.Q2L is not a school whose curriculum is made up of the play of commercial videogames, but rather a school that uses the underlying design principles of games to create highly immersive, game-like learning experiences. Games refers to several game forms and media types: digital games (online, video games, mobile games, and the like), board games, card games, social games, and game hybrids that span digital and physical space. Salen pointed out what she believes are the many virtues of game-like learning: Games are carefully designed, learner-driven systems. They can produce meaning, they are dynamic and immersive, and they provide formative feedback on an ongoing basis. Games can help players develop ways of thinking and seeing the world as being made up of a series of complex systems.Learning at Q2L takes place within a curriculum that has a foundation in math and science and aligns with New York State standards. The main courses, which Q2L calls Integrated Domains, include the following: Being, Space, and Place, a class connecting social studies with reading and writing; Codeworlds, a mix of math and English/language arts; Sports for the Mind, a class focused on digital media and game design; The Way Things Work, a science and math class where students learn how to take systems apart and put them back together again; and Wellness, a class focused on nutrition, physical education, and social and emotional health.The school day runs from 8 a.m. to 3:20 p.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, and until 1:20 p.m. on Wednesdays. The first 10 weeks of each semester focus on students completing Discovery Missions, which teachers deliver within the contexts of each of the main courses (Integrated Domains). Each Discovery Mission gives students a complex problem they must solve by completing a series of challenge-based quests.During weeks 11 and 12 students embark on an “intensive” known as a Boss Level, where students and teachers work collaboratively on a semester-ending capstone project to demonstrate the skills and competencies acquired during the previous 10 weeks. In addition, many students participate in internships, community service, and service-learning opportunities, especially once the students will reach the upper grades.Teachers work in teams and collaborate with game designers from the Institute of Play on the design of an integrated curriculum. Longer instructional periods (75 to 90 minutes) make in-depth projects and experiences possible.Blended model  Q2L’s game-like learning model emphasizes learning by doing. For many of these games, teachers rely on Web-based programs and activities. They integrate technology into the classroom to add breadth and depth to their students’ educational experiences. The Q2L designers believe that digital technology can afford students greater opportunities to create and construct knowledge, demonstrate their understanding, and express themselves, when integrated in purposeful ways. For example, Q2L has a mixed-reality learning lab where students engage in custom-designed learning scenarios around core content. Its Being Me social network site integrates a digital citizenship curriculum with tools like debates, forums, and groups that are used across all domains.Q2L’s use of digital resources in the classroom aligns best with the face-to-face-driver model of blended learning. When Q2L makes use of online learning, it is either in the form of teachers assigning online materials to model or extend the thinking around the main learning points in the unit of study, or to provide self-paced study around foreign language or math. Integration of these platforms with other learning spaces in the school, including the mixed-reality lab, physical classroom, and online social network site provides overlapping learning opportunities for students.Notable results  As a district public school, Q2L operates under the same funding formulae that the rest of New York City’s public schools do. Grants from the Institute of Play, Q2L’s core partner, support additional research and development to create the school’s custom curriculum. After the school grows to full grade capacity in 2015, it will no longer need this research and development funding.Standardized test scores for the first year, 2009–10, showed that about half of the 6th graders met state standards for math and two-thirds met standards for English. These results were roughly on par with the average for the city. A separate research study found that Q2L students showed statistically significant gains in systems thinking, teamwork, and time management. Students from a school considered to be on Q2L’s peer horizon did not show similar gains.On the horizon  In terms of lessons learned during the rollout, Salen said that an emphasis on collaboration between teachers and game designers at the Institute of Play, not just in the planning phases but also during implementation, is critical. She says Q2L must keep working to integrate more traditional assessment tools, like quizzes and exams, with the kinds of embedded, authentic assessment the Q2L model allows. Game designers and teachers need ongoing professional development to understand not only how best to work together, but how to work quickly. “The amount of new curriculum that has to be developed for the school ongoing is staggering to consider at times, and it is a core challenge to figure out how to handle the sheer enormity of the task among a small group of people,” she said. She also reported a challenge in communicating to parents about the curriculum, which uses tools that can feel unfamiliar.The Institute of Play is planning to implement the learning model in three sister charter schools in Chicago. The schools will be run by Chicago International Charter School and will share resources, curriculum, and tools developed by the Institute of Play for Q2L (see the “Chicago International Charter School” profile). The creation of these new schools poses the challenge of how to grow the model with integrity; how to implement it across grades, networks, and cities to support teachers in familiarizing themselves with the model and eventually excelling within it; and how to share what has been learned about the deployment of tools. “Growing a school model like the one developed for Q2L requires a complex orchestration of personnel, resources, methodologies, and ideas,” Salen said. “It requires meta-reflection on the systems making up the learning ecology it presupposes and a synthesis of ideas in forms that are clear, actionable, and adaptable.”Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Many courses require face-to-face meetings, such as science courses that require wet labs.Program backgroundHistory and context  To stave off the growing trend of students leaving its program to take courses at various online school programs, Riverside Unified School District (RUSD) decided in 2005 to explore options for creating its own online initiative. District officials benchmarked models in Florida, Ohio, Kentucky, and Idaho, and pilot tested an Aventa Learning AP Statistics course and AP American Government course. The pilot test enrolled 36 students in the 2005–06 school years.By the fall of 2007, Riverside Virtual School (RVS) opened its doors to 585 students. The program delivered 1,551 course enrollments in 2008–09 and 3,661 in 2009–10. Although approximately 10 percent of students enrolled at Riverside Virtual School full time, the majority used the online school to supplement their course selection. At the same time, full-time RVS students had the option to enroll at a comprehensive high school for one or more classes—or for extracurricular activities—in a face-to-face environment.Blended model  RVS purchased content from Aventa Learning and several other providers, and then broke the courses into learning modules and reconfigured them to meet the California standards and Riverside’s traditional-classroom pacing guide. RUSD chose its digital content providers specifically from those that grant access to the course content at a modular level and permission to modify, replace, and enhance content. This policy provided RUSD the opportunity to build an online program that was an extension of the instructional program of the district, as opposed to implementing separate and distinct online curricula. Generally, each course incorporated video, audio, multimedia, and text features to meet students’ various learning preferences.Students taking RVS courses today interface with RVS’s full-time staff of instructional supervisors via email, video conferencing, and drop-in office hours at the physical campus, called the Educational Options Center. Students are required to connect with teachers throughout the week, although they can fulfill this through email or videoconferencing. Many courses require face-to-face meetings, such as science courses that require wet labs, as well as courses such as physical education, art, music, and foreign languages. Overall, teachers say that they interact more with students as online teachers than when they are teaching a face-to-face course. Students also report having higher levels of engagement with their online teachers than they do in the face-to-face environment.Curriculum mirrors the pacing guides and incorporates the district-adopted materials and assessments used in Riverside Unified’s traditional classrooms. This policy allows students to comply with National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and University of California regulations related to online learning. In cases where those regulations have no impact, students are encouraged to design learning programs that best meet their individual needs. For example, the health course is not subject to NCAA or University of California review, and thus it offers an open enrollment, self-paced schedule.Blackboard manages short-cycle assessments, but students must come in to the Educational Options Center for the five to eight proctored unit exams for each course. Students must pass the mid-term and final exam and, in some courses, attend wet lab activities to receive a passing grade.Notable results  RVS collects robust data for its full-time students, and this data shows that these students on average have the highest high school scores in the district based on California’s Academic Proficiency Index (API). For the remaining 90 percent of students who take RVS courses to supplement their traditional courses, the district has had difficulty parsing the data to determine how a one-off RVS course or two affects a student’s comprehensive state assessment results. Based on anecdotal evidence, however, hundreds of students are able to access higher-level subjects and/or achieve credit-recovery objectives, thanks to newfound online accessibility through RVS.Because of the concurrent enrollment emphasis, the district has not viewed RVS as a money generator at this point. The district does not get a percentage of average-daily-attendance allocat-ions from Riverside students who take courses though RVS. It does, however, get a payment from other districts when outside students take RVS courses and receives state funding for students enrolled in the program full time. Also, the district realizes savings from the elimination of paper textbooks and other printing costs; the transition of professional development online; students completing the online health class in a third of the time as in a traditional class; and moving small-enrollment courses online.On the horizon  David Haglund and Jay McPhail, director of education options and director of instructional technology and career technical education respectively for RUSD, cite two concerns with California policies that regulate K–12 online programs. First, California’s funding regime for online courses dates back to 1950s correspondence-course regulation. The law stipulates that the state pays providers based on the number of hours of work that a student submits and requires that paper records be kept to demonstrate the allocation of hours to student work samples. RVS must employ double the clerical support to ensure compliance with this archaic attendance law, which minimizes any savings realized from the online strategy.Second, Haglund and McPhail state that California imposes onerous geographic restrictions. Riverside Unified can only educate students from counties that share at least one of its geographic borders. Thus Riverside Unified cannot serve Los Angeles County students because a narrow strip of San Bernadino County prevents the other two counties from sharing a border. This law also prevents the district from serving students in other countries. The district could potentially skirt these regulations if it were to charter, but it has resisted this option in a desire to encourage systemic reform in the state and the adoption of law and policy that support 21st-century school design.In terms of technology, Haglund and McPhail say that a top need is an adaptive platform that uses artificial intelligence software to customize and deliver a personalized learning experience for each student.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Online occurs in a separate learning lab during two-hour block periods, where students learn reading, math, and other skills.Program backgroundHistory and context  In 2006, John Danner, founder and former CEO of NetGravity, and Preston Smith, principal of the highest performing school in San Jose, Calif., founded Rocketship Education (“Rocketship”), a nonprofit charter management organization. They aspired for Rocketship Education to serve one million low-income, urban elementary students across the nation.According to Rocketship, it is the first elementary school blended-learning model. Currently, Rocketship manages three elementary schools in San Jose. The founders plan to expand nationally in 2014.Blended model  Rocketship’s blended-learning model involves 75 percent of classroom and 25 percent of online instruction. Each student attends one block of Math/Science, one block of Learning Lab, and two blocks of Literacy/Social Studies each day. During the Learning Lab block, students go to a separate room where they work on computers to focus on individual learning needs and general skills practice. This online learning and practice time allows classroom teachers to focus more of their student interactions on concept extension and critical thinking skill development.In Learning Lab, students sit at assigned computer terminals where they initially encounter a screen from which they choose the content program specified for the day. After selecting the program, students complete activities under the program’s guidance. They may also engage in offline activities, such as independent reading and enrichment programs.Rocketship uses a variety of online content programs in reading and math during the Learning Lab time. For reading, these include Headsprout, Accelerated Reader, and Rosetta Stone. For math, content providers include DreamBox, Reasoning Mind, and ALEKS.Monitors, rather than certified teachers, oversee the Learning Lab. The model allows Rocketship to staff its schools with approximately 75 percent of the usual teachers and facility space that a typical elementary school occupies. This results in an average student-to-teacher ratio of 31-to-1, although traditional classroom instruction occurs in a 23-to-1 student-to-teacher environment.Notable results  Across its two schools, Rocketship achieved 93 percent proficiency in math and 75 percent proficiency in English/language arts, which beat the state averages by 29 and 17 percentage points, respectively, and bested district averages by 26 and 14 percentage points, respectively. Rocketship’s first school, Mateo Sheedy, had an API score of 925 after its third year, which represents a ranking of 1st in Santa Clara County and 5th in California when compared to similar schools with at least 70 percent low-income students. Rocketship’s second school, Sí Se Puede, had an API score of 886 after its first year, which represents a ranking of 2nd in Santa Clara County and 15th in California, when compared to similar schools.Rocketship has set a goal for the online portion of its school day to drive one-quarter of a year of student growth. It is currently working with SRI International on a study to measure the effectiveness of its online instruction.The Learning Lab allows for cost savings of approximately $500,000 per school, which Rocketship reinvests in higher teacher salaries (roughly 20 percent higher than surrounding districts), a two-hour after-school Response-to-Intervention program, leadership training, and Academic Deans. The model also allowed the school to reach financial break-even in its first year of operation.On the horizon  Rocketship is planning to open seven additional schools in San Jose by 2013. Additionally, Rocketship is preparing for national expansion with plans to launch schools in a second region in 2014.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Meanwhile, the Job Corps program provides face-to-face vocational training.Program backgroundHistory and context  The School for Integrated Academics and Technologies (SIATech) is a charter management organization that partners with the federal Job Corps program and other Workforce Investment Act (WIA) programs to help high school dropouts in Arizona, California, Florida, and New Mexico earn high school diplomas and prepare for post-secondary careers and/or college. SIATech has co-located schools at 14 Job Corps Centers to provide the core academics (English/language arts, math, science, social science, and technology), while Job Corps provides such things as the career technical program, career readiness training, student housing, medical, dental, social development, and evening activities.Most of the students who attend a SIATech school have dropped out of traditional high schools and then joined Job Corps. Prior to the SIATech-Job Corps partnership, Job Corps students were limited to obtaining their GEDs as part of the Job Corps program, rather than obtaining a standard diploma. Most Job Corps students live full-time in dormitories at the Job Corps centers. The rest commute to the centers to attend their classes. Because of the two-year time constraint that the federal government places on Job Corps to serve students, SIATech is technically an 11th- and 12th-grade accredited school, although in practice it serves dropouts ages 16 to 24 who represent a range of grade levels.Eleven years ago SIATech officials recognized that they needed to rethink the traditional education delivery model because that approach had failed too many students. They understood that the most essential “must keep” from their traditional model was the strong one-to-one relationship between a committed teacher and the disadvantaged student. They hypothesized, however, that blending online learning into the required academic core program could offer a new, more customizable format to motivate and accelerate academic learning.Blended model  The blended model that SIATech now has in place centers around every student having an individual learning plan and a computer workstation with high-speed connectivity, more similar to an office environment than a traditional classroom. “This format supports active rather than passive learning,” said Linda Dawson, superintendent and CEO of SIATech. Students participate in an eight-hour training day, divided into four hours of academics, which SIATech provides, and four hours of career technical training, which Job Corps delivers. Most of the Job Corps portion is face-to-face. The school year extends to 230 days.The entire SIATech portion of the curriculum is available online. SIATech has created four content specialist teams that design all of its program content, combining the best and most appropriate elements from myriad content sources. SIATech outsources much of the online development of these courses to India, where engineers use a proprietary SIATech flash-based technique to make the content highly interactive. Despite its development of self-made content, SIATech has limited the licensing of its program. SIATech officials feel that because the content delivery is dependent upon effective teaching, the content itself might not be as successful or useful if used outside the SIATech instructional process.SIATech uses Blackboard ANGEL edition for the learning management system, including the platform for chatting, discussion boards, emails, and storing gradebook information. Highly qualified, subject-certified teachers and their paraprofessional assistants are physically present in the learning labs as students work both online and offline to complete their courses. The staff maintains at least a 2-to-30 adult-to-student ratio in the classroom. Students submit work to these adults online through the learning management system, where teachers access it, review it, and then report grades. The face-to-face staff provides synchronous, as-needed help and instruction to complement the online learning. Students complete the program at an individually determined pace based on their individual learning plans. Resources are available “just in time” to allow for either an accelerated or remedial pace.SIATech integrates several software programs into its academic program to help students prepare for future employment. These programs include AutoCAD, Microsoft Office, several Adobe products, Macromedia Dreamweaver, and others.Rather than adhere to seat-time metrics, SIATech focuses on students demonstrating competency. A course is complete when a student achieves 80 percent mastery based on benchmark assessments and summative evaluations. Students get real-time feedback on skill mastery through the short-cycle assessments built into the learning management system. In addition, fully online courses are available for high-stakes test preparation.Notable results  Because SIATech students tend to be highly transient, the “point in time” measures that presume continuous enrollment from September through June do not work for an open entry/exit model. Thus, high-stake tests arguably are not appropriate for SIATech because they tend to measure institutional growth rather than individual student growth. SIATech prefers a value-added model, which measures individual student growth in literacy and numeracy from the time they enter a SIATech school until they leave. Using this metric, SIATech has reported that on average, students achieve greater than two years of growth in one year in math, reading, and writing.Since 1998, nearly 10,000 out-of -school youth have earned their high school diploma at SIATech’s 14 school sites. SIATech officials reported that to the extent its blended model saves money, the school redeploys the funds in software, equipment, the extended school year, smaller class sizes, and research and development.On the horizon  SIATech hopes to scale to 10,000 students by 2015. Dawson said that charter laws can make scaling difficult, so SIATech is reformulating its delivery model to try to scale without being totally charter dependent. This will involve enhanced partnerships with Workforce Investment Act (WIA) programs, school districts, colleges, and community-based organizations.Among the top needs for SIATech scalability is access to more mobile computing devices—such as netbooks, smartphones, and iPads, for students who need to work remotely. Currently SIATech is piloting a program of issuing netbooks to students at its El Centro, Calif., campus to meet the needs of students whose schedules do not accommodate traditional school hours.In addition SIATech hopes to develop even more collaboration across its schools, both in terms of students accessing great SIATech teachers at other schools and student-to-student collaboration. “Leveraging technology for program delivery together with highly active and interactive learning based on media-rich content, ‘just in time’ learning, and expert teaching is key to future success,” Dawson said. “SIATech continues to actively pursue policy changes at the federal, state, and local levels to get rid of archaic practices that cling to seat-time and impose accountability systems that do not meaningfully assess individual student growth. The success of public education depends on how we address these needed changes. The transformation of dropouts to graduates is the prize!”Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

On the wall of one of the training centers was a sign that said, “Choose Your Modality.” Rose realized that schools would work better if students could learn each concept in the way that best suited their personal needs, rather than in a one-size-fits-all classroom. He wrote a formal proposal to the chancellor of the New York City Department of Education that summer, and by February of 2009 had closed in on seed money. Rose’s team opened the first School of One program in the summer of 2009 in a middle school in lower Manhattan.In the spring of 2010, School of One launched a seven-week after-school program at three sites and a six-week in-school program at another site. Both programs taught 6th-grade math to approximately 400 students. In the fall of 2010, School of One expanded to deliver math instruction to 1,500 students in grades 6–8.School of One funders include Robin Hood, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, NewSchools Venture Fund, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, The Broad Foundations, Cisco Systems, Inc., JP Morgan Chase, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, The Wallace Foundation, the Investing in Innovation Fund (i3), and others. Key program partners include Wireless Generation and Microsoft.Blended model  The School of One model begins with the premise that schools should start teaching children exactly where they are academically and let them progress at their own pace. School of One complements live instruction with other forms of instruction, including software, virtual tutors, and small-group instruction. It uses technology to give each student the right schedule each day.A team of 20 people administers the program from a central office, including sourcing content, assessing student progress, coordinating with school staff, analyzing performance data, refining the learning algorithm, and delivering daily schedules for students. It also develops its technology platform and oversees professional development. School of One has developed its own engine for assessment delivery and data analysis. “The whole thing requires a lot of integration,” Rose said.Most School of One environments share a similar design. The school knocks down walls in three traditional classrooms to create a large space with several learning zones, such as for independent learning, small-group collaboration, and online learning. When a child enters the program, School of One uses an assessment to diagnose precisely what she knows, and then uses an algorithm to match the student to the appropriate learning pathway. It assesses progress at the end of every day to determine the right schedule for the following day. By late afternoon, the program office sends its teachers a draft schedule for each student. Teachers can then send in requests to override the schedule when it makes sense and where possible. Each morning, the school projects the daily station assignment for each student onto monitors on the wall, similar to the flight monitors at an airport.For the summer of 2009 pilot, Rose’s team worked with over 11 content providers to amass more than 1,000 math courses across several instructional modalities. To date the program has over 5,000 lessons covering 4th to 9th grade math, which have been pulled from over 25,000 sources and 50 providers. The team repurposes the content to the appropriate length of time, skill level, and quality.Notable results  School of One has raised more than $10.5 million to fund its launch. It does not rely on per-pupil funding from the state, but instead operates primarily on private and federal grants. The program has not yet determined the pricing model it will use over the long term.Rose reports that several aspects of School of One’s model are encouraging. First, the system makes students more aware of their strengths and weaknesses than they were in a traditional classroom structure. Motivation levels have increased because students feel a desire to conquer their daily online assessments and move on to new skills. They feel less afraid to admit when they do not understand because they are all working at their own pace. Some students who did not succeed in traditional math have responded well to new modalities like independent practice, virtual tutoring, software, and small-group collaboration. Meanwhile, teachers have detailed knowledge of every student every day, which allows them to respond more appropriately to struggling students. Teachers spend less time grading assignments and more time analyzing student needs and delivering small-group or individual instruction.In terms of assessment results, Rose reported that students in the summer of 2009 pilot acquired new math skills at a rate estimated to be seven times faster than peers with similar demographics and pre-test scores. Students who participated only in the spring of 2010 in-school pilot showed gains that, when annualized, would equate to one-half to two-thirds of an additional year of gain in relation to their predicted academic trajectory without School of One. Students in the spring of 2010 after-school pilot showed significant gains across all academic quartiles, but strongest gains in the lowest quartile.On the horizon  Rose noted four areas where School of One is seeking to improve. First, the team is working on improving support for English-language learners and special education students. Second, it is trying to develop tighter alignment between content and assessments, which can all come from many different sources. Third, it is striving to incorporate projects and activities to develop critical thinking and creative problem solving skills. Finally, School of One is upgrading data systems so information can be processed more effectively and accurately.School of One will focus on 6th- to 8th-grade math for the foreseeable future while it refines its system. In the fall of 2011 it will expand to four additional New York City schools. Originally, the School of One team developed its technology in a way that was hard to scale. But now that they have run the program several times, the team is ready to rebuild a scalable version of the technology platform. Eventually Rose wants to sell the model to other districts for them to implement. Rose said that he is exploring spinning off from the New York City Department of Education to become a stand-alone nonprofit.“We want to take this slowly and make sure we get the model right,” Rose said. “There have been too many reforms over the past 25 years that have tried to scale too quickly, and many good ideas have been lost along the way. We’re not going to fall into that trap.”Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Declining public funding meant that he had trouble providing the robust curriculum for his students that he envisioned, and his rural location only exacerbated the struggle to deliver a full range of courses. Looking for answers, he talked with Lisa Gillis, president of Integrated Educational Strategies (IES), to see whether blended learning could help. As a pioneer in blended learning, Gillis had a history of helping schools survey their needs and then develop a blended model based on their goals, timeframe, and students’ needs. Hartley decided to leverage this expertise by partnering with IES to launch a blended-learning program for his district.Blended model  Hartley and Gillis agreed to a four-part technology strategy. Two parts of the strategy fell outside the definition of blended learning. For example, the first goal was to integrate online technology into traditional classrooms vis-à-vis virtual field trips, SMART boards, and other online, teacher-paced supplementation. The second initiative called for setting up the Six Rivers Virtual Academy (SRVA), a full-time virtual school for students who needed an alternative approach. SRVA opened for students beginning with the 2010–11 school year.The third piece, however, marked a step into blended learning. Beginning in the fall of 2010, leaders divided the school day at Six Rivers Charter High School into six periods. Students learned in traditional classrooms for five periods, but for the sixth period, they moved into a dedicated technology classroom for online instruction in core subjects. A facilitator monitored the students to ensure they stayed focused, but an online teacher delivered the curriculum. The facilitator also instigated face-to-face discussions, as prompted by the online teacher, in the small-group areas set up within the classroom. Hartley and Gillis believed that this “6th period” design provided an ideal solution to deliver a diversity of courses in the school’s rural setting at an affordable price. It also facilitated credit recovery for students who needed to retake a course to graduate.Fourth, the leaders set up a learning center to serve as an alternative education school for students pursuing independent study as a way to meet their personal and academic needs. Students who enrolled in this alternative program studied online remotely for four days each week and then attended the center the remaining day. The center was available for student drop-ins every day from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., if students preferred to work on-site. During the required fac-to-face days, students received help with their specific social and academic needs, including attending life-skills classes and having access to academic and technical support.Hartley and Gillis selected Odysseyware to provide the curriculum and learning management system. Northern Humboldt Union High School District had its own student information system, which did not integrate with the Odysseyware platform. Administrators have had to upload information between the two systems manually.Notable results  Initial enrollment in the learning center exceeded expectations. It grew from 15 students in September 2010 to 35 full-time and 19 concurrent students by February 2011. School leaders noted that students participating in this program showed an overall interest in subjects and higher levels of engagement. They responded well to the pacing-guide approach by demonstrating higher levels of productivity and credit recovery. Attendance rates and credit completion rates have both improved for 80 percent of participating students.In addition, the program has helped senior students who were behind get on-track to graduate. Roughly half of them follow an individual learning plan, which they formulate with their instructors. The individual plans have been instrumental in providing the necessary academic and emotional support for them to progress faster. Hartley and Gillis agree that the learning-center approach has provided a one-on-one connection and a support system that have strengthened student understanding of the material, met the diverse needs and individual learning styles of students, and built a sense of community amid an independent learning environment. Students have reported an increase in their level of confidence and commitment to perform in an academic setting.On the horizon  The next steps in the project implementation include incorporating elements of synchronous course delivery into the online learning, increasing professional development, improving academic support for students, and increasing the use of online-learning tools.Six Rivers Virtual Academy has benefited from a grant with the California K12 High Speed Network to provide a laptop for students who qualify as free-and-reduced-lunch-program participants. Support from the Northern Humboldt Union High School District also has been instrumental in the success of the program. The district especially has been proactive in providing resources for the design and implementation of the virtual academy.In terms of policy needs, school officials say that California’s UC A-G policy limits coursework that students can take online to meet the prerequisites for college admission in California, and that this poses a barrier to full online access for all students.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

They also spend significant time with hands-on projects.Program backgroundHistory and context  Dr. David C. Dwyer, a professor of educational entrepreneurship at the University of Southern California (USC), obtained permission from the USC provost to design and operate a new secondary school under the USC brand. Dwyer had served as the chief academic officer at Apex Learning and director of education technologies at Apple Computers. He felt driven to culminate his years of education and technology industry experience in the creation of a new school with a distinct blended-learning approach. USC Hybrid High School is scheduled to pilot portions of the curricular program in the fall of 2011 and then launch with 150 9th graders in the fall of 2012.Dwyer will open the new school as a charter within the USC neighborhood. The school will focus on students who are most at-risk of dropping out of high school. Because studies show that scheduling conflicts with this population account for a third of the dropouts, the new school ideally will be open 50 weeks a year, 10 hours a day, and seven days a week. Students will be able to pursue a personalized learning plan on a customized schedule.Blended model  The USC Hybrid High School model consists of three components:First, the school will feature an online, standards-based curriculum blended with face-to-face support and hands-on projects. Dwyer plans to use Apex Learning as the primary online curriculum provider because of his familiarity with Apex’s content and because of its mastery learning and independent progress features. The product also provides dynamic assessment and generates actionable data about student performance and persistence. At the same time, the program will require students to participate in collaborative inquiry projects and community service opportunities. “Hands-on learning—the messy stuff,” said Dwyer, “is essential to deep understanding and the ability to apply what you learn in the real world.” Students will complete one to three projects per year. The school will also offer on-site extracurricular activities like sports and dance.Second, the school will focus on each student’s family and community context. Drawing from the field of human developmental psychology and Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, Dwyer believes that adolescents’ basic needs—such as safety and physiological needs—must be met before they are able to work on higher-order cognitive processing and skills. The school will offer counseling and social work services, and college-preparatory and life-skill classes for students and their parents or guardians. The school will also encourage student-led service activities to help the surrounding community.Third, the school will offer a “cocoon of support” to its students through a local team of face-to-face teachers and personnel. While the online teachers will be the master teachers in their specific content areas, face-to-face teachers will provide just-in-time support and supplemental instruction for reading, math, and English proficiency. The physical facility will feature four learning labs—one for math, science, language arts, and social studies. The program will require students to complete their online work for each subject in its corresponding learning lab, and school staff will proctor all exams. Students will have a mentor who follows them through the four years and helps them put together a “calendar of responsibilities” to chart their path. They will meet every seven to 10 days to review and make adjustments to students’ schedules and academic plans. Like an adult workplace, USC Hybrid High School will be a continuous progress school, where students move through the curriculum at their own pace.Dwyer plans to develop an open-source integrated data platform that combines information about behavior, achievement, attendance, family counseling, special nutrition requirements, and the like. The system will provide appropriate access to that data for students, their parents and guardians, teachers, mentors, and administrators. Student performance data from the Apex Learning LMS will feed into this data system and allow for highly personalized, data-driven learning plans for each student.Notable results  The school is still in the conceptual stage. Dwyer is working on creating a business model that will allow the school to function on publically available dollars alone. USC is providing significant in-kind support to assist the program’s development, such as Dwyer’s salary and offices for the project’s first staff. The goal is to be self-sustaining in five years.On the horizon  Dwyer hopes this first school will be an iterative design laboratory, and that eventually he will be able to build dozens of these schools in urban settings. “The wildcard is the facility question,” he said. “I’m trying to create a design that can be implemented in a lot of different settings—like strip malls, office buildings, and old schoolhouses to reduce facility costs and ultimately make the project sustainable.”USC Hybrid high will make extensive use of technology to accomplish the following: (1) engage the school’s technology-oriented students (digital natives); (2) connect inner-city students to highly qualified teachers in all subjects; (3) provide means to collect and analyze student performance and progress data in real-time; and (4) increase the overall efficiency and cost effectiveness of the school. Dwyer believes that the necessary technology is in place to accomplish these ends.From an education policy point of view, Dwyer knows that the anytime, anywhere learning model and the seven-day-a-week nature of the program will run into stiff average-daily-attendance challenges. “The model needs to shift from ‘seat time’ to ‘learning time’ if we are ever going to make substantial progress at education reform,” he said.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Called VOISE Academy (VOISE), this school was different from many of the new high schools opening in Chicago at that time, as it blended a traditional brick-and-mortar school environment with something much less familiar—a mostly online curriculum. Now in its third year of operations, VOISE, which stands for Virtual Opportunities Inside a School Environment, plans to add a new grade each year until it serves up to 550 students in grades 9–12.VOISE was created under Chicago Public Schools’ (CPS) Renaissance 2010 initiative, the goal of which was to create 100 high-performing public schools in priority communities by the year 2010. CPS allows Renaissance schools more freedom in their curriculum and structure than traditional CPS schools in exchange for higher levels of accountability. This increased autonomy has made it possible for VOISE to employ a mostly online curriculum.Blended model  VOISE follows a traditional school calendar and daily class schedule, with highly qualified teachers in the classrooms. But teachers are not the primary source of the learning content. Instead, students generally learn at their own pace and level through online courses that they complete on wireless laptop computers, with teachers acting as the instructional guides by encouraging and mentoring students and providing individualized instruction to them on an as-needed basis.VOISE has found that its students often need the face-to-face teacher to get them started on an online module and orient them to the concepts. On average, students enter VOISE at a 4th-grade reading level and 5th-grade math level. They often find that jumping into the Apex curriculum is too demanding initially. Thus, the VOISE model has evolved to provide traditional, teacher-led instruction for roughly 20 percent of the learning time, and online learning for the other 80 percent. VOISE groups its students by level to allow teachers to gear the teacher-led instruction time to students at about the same place in the Apex curriculum. Some teachers use this time to introduce key concepts to their class before having the students move individually through an online lesson relating to that topic.Teachers also engage with students face-to-face to help them learn particular skills, such as how to research topics online, make Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, or design Web pages. For example, one history teacher had his students work in small groups to create their own imaginary city-state using Google SketchUp, a 3D modeling program, after they had completed an online lesson about ancient Greece.In addition to the regular school day, the faculty and staff offer students extra learning time with teachers on weekdays after school until 5 p.m. and Saturdays from 9 a.m. to noon. This extra learning time is critical to helping the students—many of whom are performing below grade level—develop the knowledge, skills, and character needed to succeed in school and beyond.VOISE has a high-performance culture, in which the faculty and staff impose strict standards on the students, do not accept excuses, and stress that everyone can achieve. School uniforms, clean hallways, and strict enforcement of good behavior make it clear that the faculty and staff expect students to work, not play. College banners line the walls of the school and hang in the classrooms as a reminder that higher education is an attainable goal for each student. The faculty and staff theorize that setting high expectations and offering encouragement and support will give the students reasons to work hard and develop good study habits that their environment had not previously demanded of them.Notable results  VOISE’s freshman on-track rate has increased by 10 percent each year since the school opened. The freshman on-track rate was 90 percent during year three, which was above Chicago’s average freshman on-track rate of 69 percent. This placed VOISE in the top quintile of CPS high schools. VOISE received 650 applications for 135 seats in the 2011–12 ninth grade class.CPS funds Renaissance schools on a per-pupil basis. Given the flexibility of the per-pupil funding, administrators operate VOISE with CPS dollars alone.On the horizon  In the fall of 2011, VOISE’s founding students will progress to the 12th grade. Although CPS does not have plans to replicate the school anytime soon, VOISE continues to receive national attention for its innovative learning model.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Teachers and support personnel offer help as needed.Program backgroundHistory and context  White Hat Management is an education management organization that contracts with charter schools to run their operations. To date it operates 46 schools in six states under the auspices of three separate programs. DELA (Distance & Electronic Learning Academies) schools are state virtual schools for grades K–12, where students study completely remotely. HOPE Academies are charter schools that serve K–8 students in the state of Ohio. LifeSkills Centers are alternative education charter schools catering to students between the ages of 16 and 21 in Ohio, Florida, Colorado, and Arizona and between the ages of 16 and 19 in Michigan. This report focuses on the LifeSkills Centers, as they are home to the blended-learning aspect of White Hat’s operations.Blended model  White Hat renovates old buildings and storefronts, such as Rite Aids and CVSs, to use as LifeSkills Centers. Each renovated building features a front desk with a receptionist and behind that, a large lab space with computer workstations for 35 to 40 students. White Hat serves students who have dropped out of high school or who are at-risk of dropping out. Often social service agencies refer them to the program. The school day is only four hours long. Students can choose between the 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. session and the 12:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. session. Some schools offer a third session at night.When they first enroll at a LifeSkills Center, students spend two to four weeks in a “transition lab,” where they complete social and learning surveys, do activities on the Web-based Achieve3000 reading program, and meet with a psychologist, social worker, employability teacher, math teacher, reading teacher, and special-needs teacher. From there, they transition into the large lab space and begin their for-credit courses and rely on the individualized learning roadmaps that the team created for them during the transition period.LifeSkills Centers use Apex Learning curriculum for all content delivery. Their own face-to-face teachers provide the flexible teaching support instead of online Apex teachers. White Hat uses Apex because it has found that Apex offers challenging curriculum that is easily customizable for each student. Two certified teachers are on hand in the lab to provide flexible support during all hours the school is open. Most students complete one half-credit in one-and-a-half months. Students can take up to two courses at a time.LifeSkills Centers draw funding from the per-pupil allocations that each state provides. They also apply for federal funding, such as Title I grants. The centers report their results on a state-by-state basis through PowerSchool.Notable results  White Hat says that it is successful with 50 to 60 percent of the students who enroll. It served 8,000 students in 2010. Since 1998, has graduated approximately 10,000 students altogether.On the horizon  Kerry Jupina, vice president at White Hat who oversees the LifeSkills Centers, said that White Hat plans to expand the program beyond the five states that it currently serves. She said that the biggest obstacle to rapid expansion is that charter school boards typically want to see immediate results, but that the dropout population of students requires patience and time to get back on track.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Other students make up credits in a computer lab on a traditional campus after traditional school hours, with face-to-face teacher support.Program backgroundHistory and context  Wichita Public Schools (Wichita), located in south central Kansas, is a large urban school district that serves a racially and socioeconomically diverse student population. With more than 50,000 students, it is one of the largest school districts in the Midwest and educates approximately 11 percent of all public school students in Kansas.Wichita began contracting with Apex Learning during the 2007–08 school year to provide online courses to students enrolled in the Learning Centers, the district’s dropout-recovery and credit-recovery program. Previously, the program, which began in 1999, had used two different server-based computer programs for its curricula. In 2007, the program’s administrators decided to update the curricula and, in particular, switch from a server-based to an online curriculum. They believed that online courses would be cheaper and more convenient to maintain. After researching online options, they selected Apex Learning primarily because its courses were more rigorous than other online courses the district had tested and were aligned to state standards. During the 2008–09 school year, the Learning Centers program served 1,361 students in 3,257 enrollments.Blended model Dropout recovery Wichita operates four dropout-recovery centers, which are located in storefront spaces at local malls and in office spaces at community centers. All of the centers are similarly designed with a large, open space divided into a variety of work areas, including individual study stations equipped with roughly 30 computers with headsets; tables for group study and project work; a sitting area with couches and lounge chairs for comfortable reading, one-on-one interaction with teachers, student discussions, and peer counseling; a resource center with instructional materials and career information; and an office space equipped with desks for the teachers.Each dropout-recovery center employs two full-time, licensed teachers—one for English and social studies and another for mathematics and science—who grade essays and written assignments, monitor student progress, assist with coursework as needed, and make sure students stay on task. Each center also employs either a social worker or a student support staffer, who coordinates and arranges for various services such as mentoring, child care, transportation, meal vouchers, and housing.Students generally take only one course at a time to help them focus on mastering the material rather than balancing too many courses at once. Once they have satisfied the district’s graduation requirements, the students receive a standard high school diploma—rather than a GED—from one of Wichita’s traditional high schools.The program does not require student attendance during set hours each day. Instead, students may go to the centers at any time between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Mondays through Thursdays and between 8 a.m. and noon on Fridays. Although it gives students the flexibility to set their own schedules, the program requires them to complete at least a half credit each month and attend the centers for at least 15 hours per week to remain enrolled. Outside of these requirements, students are free to divide their study time between the dropout-recovery centers, where they have access to a teacher, and home. This flexibility allows students to work around their employment and family schedules—and it also enables the dropout-recovery centers to serve a greater number of students. During the 2008–09 school year, Wichita’s dropout-recovery centers helped 912 students complete 2,326 enrollments.Credit recovery Seven of the district’s 11 traditional high schools have credit-recovery centers located inside the school buildings where students can go after school to retake the courses they have failed. Each credit-recovery center consists of a room lined with rows of computers (there are roughly 30 computers in each center) and an office space with a desk for the teacher. One or two teachers who teach at the high school where the credit-recovery center is located take turns staffing the center after school in exchange for hourly pay.The credit-recovery centers are open until 6 p.m. on Mondays through Fridays. Student attendance is not required during set days or hours. This flexibility allows students to work around their after-school activities and enables the centers to serve a greater number of students. To motivate students to finish their online courses, the district charges current high school students a fee of $75 per half-credit course (dropouts pay a yearly registration fee of $5), but offers at least 100 scholarships every year to students who cannot afford to pay the course fee. During the 2008–09 school year, Wichita’s credit-recovery centers helped 449 students complete 931 enrollments.Notable results  Since the program’s founding in 1999, the four dropout-recovery centers have collectively helped 974 students that the traditional schools had failed earn their high school diplomas—or roughly 26 percent of the students they have so far served or are still in the process of serving.The district’s graduation rate was still below the state average in 2006, but it had risen by more than eight percentage points since the Learning Centers program first began in 1999. An increase in the graduation rate of minorities had driven much of this, as graduation rates for African Americans had risen by 17.4 percentage points and Hispanics by 22.3 percentage points between 1999 and 2006.One reason for this increase was undoubtedly the credit-recovery portion of the program, which allowed students who might have dropped out or failed to graduate on time because they were missing credits to recover these courses and graduate. Another reason was the additional graduates from the dropout-recovery centers, which accounted for roughly a percentage point increase in any given year in the district’s graduation rate.Unlike other schools in the district, the program does not require, nor does it receive, any portion of district funds obtained from property taxes. This means that the program is significantly less expensive to operate on a per-pupil basis than traditional schools in the district. For example, even if one considers all of the costs—operating and capital—of the Learning Centers program during the 2008–09 school year, the cost per dropout-recovery student was roughly $3,969—or approximately $7,721 less than the district’s per-pupil expenditure for the 2008–09 school year. This number does not take into account that the program also served 449 credit-recovery students during the 2008–09 school year, which means that the program’s true costs per student were even lower.On the horizon  Wichita does not plan to expand the Learning Centers program, and it recently decided to close one of the dropout-recovery centers. The state’s new graduation formula only counts students who graduate in four years, so district leaders believe the district will earn a higher Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) status if they focus resources on students who fall within their four-year cohort at the comprehensive high schools, rather than invest in students who are taking more than four years to graduate.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Innosight InstituteLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

In building our school design, we are working to re-imagine what education looks like in light of learning. We are drawing from powerful philosophies and teaching models, both old and new, and recombining them to create something fresh that returns to timeless truths.Every learner is unique, capable, curious, creative and in constant process of piecing together how the world works. All of these factors must be taken into consideration when designing a curriculum. No boxed curriculum will ever be able to meet the unique cognitive, social-emotional, physical and creative developments of a child. The boxed curricula that most schools utilize are simply too narrow in scope to address the needs of creative beings. At Anastasis Academy, we use a completely customized, integrative curriculum approach that allows room for meaningful connections across learning, exploration, discovery and active learning. Learners are free to explore their individual interests and passions with the support of teachers and classmates. We customize the learning and curriculum to meet the needs, interests and learning styles of every learner while working within an established framework (Common Core Standards) that leads children along a consistent learning path.In personalizing education in this way, we are able to truly educate the whole child by utilizing their strengths to build up areas of weakness. Teachers, parents and students work together to carefully consider individual needs, learning styles, prior knowledge, strengths, abilities, passions, interests and vulnerabilities of each learner. Teachers will partner together with students and families to create individualized learning plans that seek out entry points into content, engaging learners by using the modes and styles of learning that best meet their needs. Learners will be challenged to grow and stretch in new directions while remaining connected to who they are created to be.Blended model  Anastasis Academy 8:15 a.m. – 3:15 p.m.8:15 a.m. – 8:30 a.m. Morning mile: students and teachers walk a mile as a school (parents welcome) 8:30 a.m. – 9 a.m. Morning meeting (devotion/prayer, welcome, activity, pledge) 9 a.m. – 12 p.m. Transdisciplinary inquiry block (primary and secondary students separated) 12 p.m. – 12:45 p.m. Lunch/Recess 12:45 p.m. – 3:15 p.m. Custom learning block (students work with teachers in groups of 10 based on development) 3:15 p.m. – 3:30 p.m. Carpool (soft close) 3:15 p.m. – 4 p.m. Extended learning opportunity*Physical education will take place throughout the week in the gym as well as once a week during the morning block with a certified PE teacher. *Chapel will be held once a week.Wednesday: Late Start 9:15 a.m. Friday: Half day 12:45 p.m. (learning excursions)At Anastasis Academy, our school structure has a very distinct rhythm. Students participate in teacher facilitated inquiry for the morning block and personalized learning projects in the afternoon block. The school day begins at 8:15 a.m. with a whole-school walk. We start our day with a walk to get the blood flowing to the brain with exercise before we begin learning. The school day officially ends at 3:15 p.m., but teachers are available to students until 4 p.m. each day in order to provide them with maximum learning opportunities, as well as flexibility for working parents.The entire morning, every morning, is dedicated to intensive learning and inquiry in a 15-to-1 student-to-teacher ratio. During the morning block, students are learning how to be a learner. They are “apprentices” in the art of learning. Meaningful time is spent learning how to be inquirers, how to construct knowledge and the discipline it takes to be a learner within a transdisciplinary model. This provides students the opportunity to ask that last question, take the debate one step further and continue learning well after the traditional class period is over. Nine areas are explored in this transdisciplinary learning block including language arts, social studies, science, mathematics, physical awareness/health/play, spirituality, social/emotional learning, the arts and global citizenship.In the afternoon block, students complete independent studies and participate in collaborative learning teams centered on similar interests, learning goals and abilities. Students are broken into groups of ten based on developmental level, interests and learning styles. Teachers facilitate learning with customized curriculum that takes into account each student’s learning styles, interests, passions, developmental levels and prior knowledge. This customization takes place within the framework of Common Core Standards to ensure that each student leaves Anastasis Academy with a critical mass of knowledge that will act as the foundation for future learning.Every learner is unique, capable, curious, creative and in constant process of piecing together how the world works.

PASCAL has a number of 100% online students and uses the online Driver, but Odysseyware is also used for individual students within the Fusion and HighSchool to College programs.Program backgroundHistory and context  Since 1997, a small, vibrant charter school in St. Paul has been quietly pushing the leading edge in educational circles. Founded by LodeStar guru Robert Bilyk as a school that uses the latest technology to meet the needs of chronically ill students, it has expanded to become a virtual village of 133 students from all over the Twin Cities and into the far reaches of the state.Cyber Village now serves students in grades 3–12 (expanded from the original 4th–8th grades) with a powerful combination of online and on campus options. Students in grades 6-8 participate in the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Program, 11th and 12th graders may participate in supported Post Secondary Education Options college level classes. Without much fanfare, CVA pioneered the blended format of 3 days per week on campus classes and 2 days per week online. Online lessons are built by the teachers and based on State curricular goals. A variety of interactive approaches allow students to continue their studies both on and off the computer.The High School to College program is geared toward students who want to participate in Post Secondary Education Options. The 9th and 10th grade years use a blended program similar to the lower school but with an emphasis on career exploration, internships, experiential learning and skills as well as academic preparation for taking college classes in the 11th and 12th grades. While students are taking college courses via the internet or on college campuses they continue to enjoy the support of a mentor and cohort of CVA classmates.All grades still have the choice of a 100% online option geared toward the chronically ill, hospitalized, traveling or professional student, and families who want or need more flexible educational options.In an academically rigorous, intellectually stimulating and whole child oriented environment, CVA is an ideal setting for divergent thinkers, Twice Exceptional students, Gifted/Talented students and families who want to be involved in their children’s educations. Cyber Village Academy strives to provide individualized learning plans for each student. Students who take the full course of Spanish studies are able to place into 3rd year High School level Spanish during their 9th grade year. Advanced math students in 8th grade may gain high school credit in Geometry. The strength of flexible scheduling allows for extensions such as Future City, Lego Robotics, Eagle Bluff, Space Camp, Concordia Language Village Field Trips, Handbells, yearbook, soccer, volleyball, newsletter, student council and more.While Mr. Bilyk has moved on to supporting his LodeStar online lesson building platform full time, the little niche school he founded has grown up and established itself as the model for effective 21st century education.Blended model  Fusion Program serves grades 4-8 with 3 days on campus, 2 on line. On line lessons are developed by the teachers teaching the on campus classes and are specific to those lessons. They are delivered on a Moodle platform. The campus holds regular classes on M-W and is open as a study center or for individualized instruction on Th-F.High School to College program serves grades 9-12 and has classes on campus M-T, with W-F classwork accessed on line. The campus study center is open for use for these students on W-F. Internships and community involvement also take place during the off campus days. During 11th and 12th grades the majority of coursework is taken on college campuses. Students meet with their advisor and cohort at least once weekly for support and collaboration.The older the students are, the more like coaches the teachers become. In the lower school they are more similar to traditional teachers, by 12th grade they are support personnel.Notable results  academic success is our primary impact, particularly for the non-traditional student. This includes gifted/talented, twice exceptional, professional, as well as general education, Title One and Special Education students.Our students regularly represent the school at state and national level competitions (History Day, Science Fair, and the like).On the horizon  We continue to develop the High School to College program to include more possibilities for internships, professional mentorships and community involvement. Our growth plans for the 3-8 program involve newer technology and more technology support, counciling and paraprofessional staff. Within the next 10 years we plan to expand down to the Kindergarten level with an IB Primary Years Program for the K-5 grades.Our wish list includes updated technology in the classrooms and expanded software packages.Submitted by Lauren Odle on May 6, 2011Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Reader-generated profilesLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Residents of Incline Village, Nevada, decided the solution to the education problems would not come from their schools or government. Kathryn Kelly, a local homeschooling parent and trained scientist, chose to do something about this perceived dearth of opportunities. The eLearning Café (Café) was born out of her desire to bring the vast resources of online learning to the rural Nevada town. The Café opened in February 2011 and was incorporated as a formal 501c3 non-profit in August, then able to accept formal donations and apply for grants. The Café met with initial public suspicion, but was widely supported and promoted by the early adopters. The principals of the local middle school and high schools became ardent supporters of Café’s efforts despite considerable staff resistance. In one year, over 200 students have used the resources at eLearning Café to engage in blended-learning experiences.Blended model eLearning Café provides space and support for students desiring to enrich their education through online course options. The focus is primarily math, science, and English for grades 6-12, but there are additional offerings for K-5, college, and adult learners as well. About 80 percent of K-12 students that frequent the Café also take classes at a nearby public school. Many of these students walk to the Café during free periods to work on online courses and others come after school. The Café is open seven days a week, 12 hours a day.The café is staffed by several teachers, both credentialed and non-credentialed, who act as facilitators of instruction. These teachers devote nearly all their time to explaining new concepts, demonstrating in labs, answering questions, grading papers, and encouraging success. In a blended environment focused on subject mastery, the teachers are relieved from the administrative tasks of documenting attendance, grading simple quizzes, meetings, and other activities that detract from the joy of teaching and time to do it well. Students progress though online courses, with the aid of the Café’s teachers, at their own pace.Parents pay for online courses a la carte. eLearning Café prices courses based on the content provider’s fee plus a premium to fund operations. Parents pay separately by the hour for face-to-face tutoring and other services.eLearning Café makes a concerted effort to: identify high-quality online content and choose courses that will best meet student needs; keep close communication with parents via weekly emails or visits; and help increase understanding and acceptance of blended learning in the community.Notable resultsThe ability to absorb information and master material at their own pace has instilled a noticeable increase in students’ confidence. Students who have not succeeded in a traditional school environment seem to be thriving in this flexible and personalized environment. Many students and parents have expressed ardent satisfaction with increased student progress.Due to the relative infancy of eLearning Café’s services, extensive quantifiable results are not yet available. However, among math performance in grades 3-12, the Café has documented significant gain in grade level, topics learned, and proficiency versus time spent on certain concepts.On the horizonTo provide for truly differentiated learning, eLearning Café currently uses content from seven different providers, which causes administrative complexity. Therefore, they hope to find a truly integrated, all-encompassing Student Information System that will allow all instructors, students, parents, and local schools to keep track of student progress. They also hope for blended learning to be more fully recognized and supported in Nevada state law. In 2012, eLearning Café plans to implement additional tools and resources to help English learners increase reading comprehension and fluency. They also hope to more fully document and quantify outcomes in the next year.The Café also plans to design and build an additional community learning center to provide space for quiet instruction, guest lectures, computer instruction for seniors, small group tutorials, Space Science for Schools, Lego Robotics. This space will also include a science lab to teach science at all grade levels.Submitted by Kathryn Kelly on November 12, 2011Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Reader-generated profilesLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Students complete their online work at their own pace either at home or at one of eSchool’s learning labs. Courses are taught by online teachers employed by eSchool, which also employs academic mentors to monitor student progress.Program backgroundHistory and context  Founded in 2009, eSchool Provo (eSchool) has quickly evolved into one of the fastest growing online schools in Utah. In November of 2010, 14 students were enrolled in eSchool, and as of February 2012 that number has risen to roughly 450. Full-time virtual students account for about 45 percent of the student base at eSchool; the remaining 55 percent (about 250 students) are taking one or more online classes along with traditional face-to-face classes at their brick-and-mortar school.One reason for this substantial growth is Utah Senate Bill 65, which allows students in Utah to take up to 2.0 credits from any accepted online provider. This increased eSchool’s market from roughly 15,000 students to 600,000 students. eSchool has signed exclusive distribution agreements with vendors that provide technology and language courses that are not offered anywhere else in Utah. This has also contributed to eSchool’s growth.Blended model  Students enrolled in brick-and-mortar schools can supplement their class schedule with courses administered by eSchool. Students progress through their online courses at their own pace either from home or from one of eSchool’s learning labs located in district schools and eSchool’s downtown headquarters. These classes are asynchronous and can be taken during a free period at school or after school at students’ convenience.eSchool employs two mentors to help track all students’ progress and engagement. Online teachers specific to each online course communicate with students via web chats, Illuminate sessions, phone calls and during occasional in-person meetings.More than half of eSchool’s students are from the city of Provo. In order to foster a strong neighborhood learning community, eSchool invites students to work on their courses at the learning lab at their headquarters in downtown Provo during specific times (Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings). This open lab time has proved popular, with the occasional pizza party adding to the fun. eSchool plans to implement similar programming as new learning labs open.Notable results  As noted above, eSchool has seen impressive growth in enrollment — over 3,000 percent in one year.Academic performance, while appearing solid thus far, is in the infancy stage in terms of measurement. eSchool met AYP in 2010-11 in all areas. Even with substantial growth, it is projected that eSchool students will again meet AYP in the 2011-2012 school year. eSchool recognizes that some students thrive in a blended environment, while others do not. Therefore, the district employs the expertise of a seasoned professional marketer to help target and determine which students would be a good fit.On the horizon  Going forward, more district resources will be allocated to the program if the results continue to be impressive. Parents and students are showing increasing interest in this dual-enrollment option. Blended learning will be at the forefront of the district’s plans in the coming years.By next year, eSchool plans to add two additional learning labs in district schools to continue to foster student engagement.eSchool is working on streamlining the student, parent, and mentor experience with a single dashboard that would display announcements, assignments, and assessments. Because eSchool currently uses a number of different course providers this aggregated information is currently not readily available, and that has proved a stumbling block for parents and mentors trying to track student progress.eSchool  plans to continue growing in enrollment, and to target Provo and non-Provo students equally in the future. Administrators project that there will be 1,500 students in the program by 2015, with perhaps one-third of those students not from Provo. The district’s main focus, however, is not enrollment growth but quality development. eSchools hopes to continually evaluate their programs and provide increasingly better courses and resources for students.Submitted by Mark Holley on October 14, 2011Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Reader-generated profilesLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Students can elect to enroll in online courses as supplements to their brick-and-mortar courses or as a means for credit recovery. This online option provides greater choice for students who have not thrived in traditional school settings, desire to take a course that is not offered at the brick-and-mortar school, or require flexibility in their course schedule. Most courses are taught by FCA teachers and students can work through courses at their own pace.Program backgroundHistory and context  Faith Christian Academy (FCA) is a private religious school that has been serving students since 1972. In 2007, FCA instituted its online-learning program to provide opportunities for home educated students and students who were struggling in the traditional school setting. Working in conjunction with Seven Star Academy, FCA has provided all students in grades 6-12 the option of taking a full course-load online or blending online courses with traditional courses.Blended model  FCA offers online courses in partnership with Seven Star Academy to students in grades 6-12. Students can choose online courses from among Seven Star’s 200+ offerings as well as from several courses created by FCA teachers in Moodle. All courses are taught by FCA-employed online teachers, except for those in which there is no qualified teacher for a particular subject matter. Students work with academic counselors to decide if online, self-directed options are best for their learning style and to determine the best way to blend their online and face-to-face classes. Some students work on their online courses in the school computer lab, whereas others complete their work at home. All online tests must be taken on campus in the computer lab. FCA employs one online coordinator to oversee all online learning at the school. The coordinator is responsible for monitoring student progress, assisting students in the lab, and ensuring course completions and reporting.Within each online course, there is a minimal pace chart that is organized weekly to help students keep on track to complete the course by the end of the semester. If a student desires to move faster through a course, however, she can arrange an accelerated schedule with her teacher and take tests and/or complete the course at any time. Each online teacher sets up a schedule of communication with his or her students, which includes personal emails at last once a week and phone calls as needed. Because most of the online teachers are local, students can also arrange to meet with them face-to-face.Notable results  Administrators at FCA report that the level of engagement among students who have opted to take an online course has skyrocketed. Students are excited and energized by the flexibility that online options provide and many thrive in an environment where they can work at their own pace. The online and blended schedules have significantly helped re-engage students whose learning styles caused them to struggle in the traditional classroom. Students have been successful in earning credit through the online courses, and the number of students taking advantage of the online program has continuously grown from year to year. Additionally, because of the lower cost of online courses in comparison to face-to-face courses, the online program has allowed greater financial flexibility for students who otherwise may not have been able to remain enrolled at FCA.On the horizonFCA hopes to offer an even wider array of courses to its students in the future. Administrators are also hoping to incorporate dual enrollment courses to allow students to earn college credit online. Additionally, FCA would like to reach out more effectively to home-educating families and to recognize and respond more fully to students whose learning styles correspond better with online options than traditional face-to-face courses. In the future, administrators are hoping that more of the online offerings will be courses written by FCA’s own teachers. FCA seeks to continually improve the quality and enhance the effectiveness of its online offerings.Submitted by Eve Wall on January 18, 2012Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Reader-generated profilesLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Teachers are teaching face to face on a daily basis and use the online courses to address student needs as a whole group and individually. They can assign lessons, homework, use the threaded discussion boards, have students submit work through the online course to use the built-in anti-plagiarism tools, use assessments, etc.Rotation: We call this our hybrid option. Some teachers in traditional schools/classrooms opt to instuct face to face for 1-2 days a week and the remainder of the week have their students be fully online. For students who need extra support, they can come in to receive one on one instructional support. Teacher is teaching online when not meeting with class. Can help with large classrooms. Teacher divides students into cohorts and meets with cohort groups on different days of the week. When not meeting, students are working online.Flex: Our high schools offer credit recovery programs on-site in computer labs where students drop in during free periods to work on their credit recovery classes that are offered in an online format. There is teacher suppport for core courses in the room to answer questions and to offer one one one assistance. The district offers a financial allocations to each school to help with the costs for running these programsOnline Lab: This model is being used primarily with middle schools. Traditional schools offer an open lab for students to work in their online courses during the class period(s) in their schedules assigned for the online class. These labs are monitored by paraprofessionals and the students’ teachers for the online courses are teaching fully online. The lab is open for all class periods to students who are some online classes.Self-Blend: We call this our supplemental option. All middle school and high school students in our school district have LMS accounts. All have the option to enroll in some online courses through our online school and some traditional courses taught in their local brick and mortar schools. The online courses are not necessarily an addition to their full schedules. They are included in the regular student schedules. Students can take a combination of online and face to face course to complete their schedules. Typically, our high school students work on their online courses remotely- at their homes.Online Driver: This option is available via our online school, Jeffco’s 21st Century Virtual Academy. All content and instruction is delivered via an online platform with students working remotely. We offer face to face intervention for struggling students. We also offer an array of extracurricular activities such as clubs, fieldtrips, and social events.Program backgroundHistory and context  Jeffco Public Schools is the largest district in Colorado. We are considered a traditional school district which includes:85,000 students (34th largest school district in the U.S.)155 schools17 high schools, 20, middle schools, 94 elementary, 10 option schoolsWe are facing large budget reductions this year ($40M).Jeffco started looking at how online education could help with school district with challenges we have been facing for years. District challenges include improving graduation & dropout rates, ensuring 21st century teaching/learning in a digital world, supporting 21st century community & staff, student engagement- digital learners, access and options for accelerated students, and expanding the learning space to meet student and school needs.Blended model  Face-to-Face Driver: Traditional classroom teachers are trained to utilize online courses as resources to enhance instruction, collaboration, intervention, and independent study for acceleration.

In the two years since we started district-wide implementation, we grew to 7,500 students.On the horizon  Long-term growth includes:Extending the options to elementary studentsMobile Learning- more access for more studentsLearning Playgrounds- creating virtual spaces that includes content for specific learning needs such as playgrounds for gifted students that include content specifically designed for their areas of giftednessBuilding supports for ESL students, programsOur wish list includes removing seat time barriers which don’t support online or blended models and removing one-time count data for funding. For technology, we need to ensure school districts are open to and building systems that adapt to any device used by students and teachers to access online content. Also, ensuring districts have the capacity (bandwidth) to host online/blended education on a large scale.Submitted by Judy Bauernschmidt on May 4, 2011Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Reader-generated profilesLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Teachers use data from their students’ Khan Academy work to drive instruction and interventions.Program backgroundHistory and context  Los Altos School District has a history of strong performance and tied as the top-scoring district in California on the 2011 Academic Performance Index (API). A strong belief among the district that 21s- century learning and innovation is important to every student’s education motivated the adoption of Khan Academy to supplement existing math curriculum.In 2010, Los Altos School District worked closely with Khan Academy to launch a pilot program in three 5th grade classes and two 7th grade classes. Students were provided with laptops and worked at their own pace through the Khan Academy math program during designated periods of time during the school day. Teachers and administrators soon noticed increased student engagement, enthusiasm, ownership, and performance.In the 2011-2012 school year, the program expanded to include all nine schools, all 5th and 6th grade classrooms, and many 7th and 8th grade math classes. Over 1,000 students in Los Altos School District use Khan Academy for math instruction and practice.During the initial pilot, representatives from the district met every few weeks with Khan Academy to create a very tight design loop to help improve an already tremendous electronic tool. Los Altos School District continues to work closely with the Khan Academy implementation team.Blended model  As directed by individual teachers, students are required to spend fixed amounts of time working on math via Khan Academy during their math period. Students move through the Khan Academy lessons and practice exercises at their own pace, and teachers receive real-time data on student performance.Using Khan Academy in the classroom allows students to set individual goals that focus on their needs and then allows them to work at their ability to achieve those goals. While students are working independently and collaboratively with each other, there is more time for the teacher to work one-on-one with students who are struggling and need further intervention.Khan Academy concepts are arranged on a “Knowledge Map” which builds from the most basic mathematical concept to more complex concepts covered in high school calculus. Students work through practice exercises and tutorials, watching instructional videos when more explanation is needed. The software suggests next steps for students and provides teachers with a wealth of individualized student data on both concepts mastered and areas of struggle. Teachers use the data generated through Khan Academy, received in real-time in the classroom and searchable later, to group students according to their instructional need and provide targeted math instruction.Khan Academy supplements and integrates with the current Los Altos School District math curriculum, including project-based learning. For example, before embarking on a project to create a floor plan that tests knowledge of the area of polygons, the teacher might leverage the dashboard to make sure all students have the foundational skills necessary. Teachers can group students by skill or area of struggle, and Khan Academy can facilitate peer tutoring, allowing kids who have mastered a lesson to coach others who are still working on it.The key is that with Khan Academy, teachers are able to base their decisions on real-time data and have the flexibility and tools to be able to differentiate the instruction. The blended-learning environment in Los Altos schools provides for targeted intervention, flexible groupings, data-driven instruction, active coaching, meaningful collaboration, personal goal-setting, and increased student voice and choice.Notable results  No scientific study has yet been conducted, but one measure of success has been the California Standards Test (CST) that Los Altos students took at the end of the 2010-2011 school year. In two of the 7th grade classrooms where students did not historically perform well in math, there were significant increases in CST scores. Forty-one percent of the students were proficient or advanced, compared to just 23 percent the prior year. In the 5th grade classrooms, Los Altos students historically perform quite well and they continued to do so. Over 96 percent of students in the pilot classrooms were proficient or advanced, but that is comparable to the non-pilot district-wide performance (91 percent). However, CST exam results do not tell the whole story, since the test only measures performance on grade-level skills. Significant benefits in allowing students to challenging themselves with more advanced topics were also noticed with Khan Academy. The district is now working on how to better evaluate these above-grade-level learning gains.On the horizon  Los Altos School District hopes to acquire more laptops to create a 1:1 environment in the future. Administrators are also open to exploring the possibility of using Khan Academy and/or other online resources to enrich subject areas other than math.Teachers, students, and administrators maintain a blog on Los Altos School District’s website as a way to continually monitor progress with the program.Los Altos School District continues to work closely with the Khan Academy team to provide feedback to improve the product and its implementation. Students are encouraged to give feedback on how the Khan Academy program works. Teachers in the district are encouraged to try many different implementation techniques and to use the data they receive from Khan Academy in more innovative ways.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Reader-generated profilesLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Some teachers use Angel as the driving tool for their curriculum while others use it for content acceleration and remediation.Program backgroundHistory and context  Luella Middle School began its blended journey in the summer of 2009 and prides itself on access to technology and the integration of technology into its students’ lives. Preparing students for a 21st century work place that demands the ability to use technology while continuing to learn new skills is of the utmost importance for our teachers. Our teachers from the beginning have authored, created ,and molded their original courses work to best meet the needs of each of their students. While we are not satisfied with our current content or practices, we do strive to improve our implementation of blended learning on a daily basis.Blended model  In our blended-learning model, students have an online course that follows their face-to-face instruction in the classroom. Our LMS, ANGEL, allows students to learn, study, and submit work digitally from school and home while giving parents access to the work that students are doing in their classrooms on a daily basis. We offer parent logins for ANGEL. In the classroom some teachers utilize angel in a teacher-led model while using Angel with a projector to present the learning material. We also have some teachers who use Angel in a rotating center approach to help with acceleration or remediation of course content.Notable results  Luella Middle School has met AYP for the last two school years.On the horizon  In the future, Luella Middle School would like to increase accessibly to the many technology tools in Henry County Schools with Bring Your Own Technology. This would enable students to bring their own device to access the internet and all of the networked resources available in Henry County Schools. Luella would also like to acquire some more interactive content to enhance the blended content available to students, teachers, and parents.Submitted by Aaryn Schmuhl on May 23, 2011Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Reader-generated profilesLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Students receive classroom math instruction from their teachers, who integrate the ST Math games into whole-class instruction to further demonstrate math concepts.Program backgroundHistory and context  The non-profit MIND Research Institute (MIND) is dedicated to enabling elementary and secondary school students to reach their full potential through developing and deploying visually-based math instructional software and systems. MIND also conducts basic neuroscience, mathematics, and education research to improve math education and advance scientific understanding. MIND was founded in 1998 by scientists from University of California campuses of Berkeley, Irvine, and Los Angeles. These researchers came together to apply neuroscience findings indicating that children interacting with software games using visual, language-free animation to demonstrate math concepts showed significant improvement in their ability to conduct spatial-temporal reasoning, or the ability to manipulate objects visually in space and time. These results prompted the scientists to found MIND, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, and further develop the visual learning-based ST Math® software for use in elementary school. MIND’s first randomized pilot study of the visually-based software games in a South Central Los Angeles elementary school confirmed the significant impact of the software on student math proficiency. This 1999 study showed nearly a 30-point increase in percentage points for “proficient” on standardized math tests among high-need students.MIND’s ST Math software games use visual, interactive animation of graphically-rich objects to improve spatial temporal reasoning, which lies at the core of innovative thinking and sophisticated problem-solving. Through a 1:1 adaptive learning environment, the games are scaffolded and provide immediate feedback. Teachers receive professional development in the teaching of mathematics through spatial visualization software. Through the software system, educators are able to access real-time student learning data, allowing for differentiation. Teacher-guided instruction integrating ST Math activities in the classroom rounds out the blended learning model.Blended model  ST Math for K-5 is designed to help all students reach math proficiency through self-paced, language-independent, mastery-based objectives. It is aligned to State and Common Core Standards and builds the conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills needed for success in math. In order to realize maximum benefit and student gains, students should complete 75% or more of the ST Math games by state testing time. To achieve this, students should access ST Math for 90 minutes per week, typically broken down into 45-minute sessions, in a dedicated computer lab or mobile computer lab. Classroom teachers should proactively monitor student progress through the real-time reporting feature of the software system. Training is provided by MIND to help teachers utilize the reports to differentiate their instruction; MIND staff also monitor teacher implementation and follow up as necessary to help maintain recommended progress milestones. Teachers are provided with classroom activities associated with the learning objectives found in the ST Math games to help them make the connections between what students are learning individually through the visual software games to what they are learning in their traditional classroom math instruction. Interactive whiteboard functionality is available to teachers to further capitalize on the visual nature of the ST Math approach.ST Math for Pre-K is designed to teach preschoolers basic math concepts and skills addressed in the NCTM Prekindergarten Curriculum Focal Points, as well as to explore and develop other essential skills that are vital in a child’s overall development. The research-based curriculum, which is aligned to individual state standards, is comprised of ST Math software games and non-technology (hands-on, concept-based activities and language integration activities) components. Math concepts presented to children via the software games encourage thinking and application through visualization. Since learning is typically an integrated experience for young children, the learning from the visual games in the software is supported by teacher-guided activities, including those that are language-based. Incorporating language and literacy skills into the program provides children with the opportunity to learn in multiple modalities and connects math language to visual and spatial skills. The language/literacy component allows teachers to reinforce math concepts throughout the day in various areas of the classroom even when children are not at the computer. The other type of activity is the concept related hands-on activity used to reinforce the objective(s) of each game and to introduce or support game concepts and skills.ST Math for Secondary Intervention (SI) is designed for struggling middle or high school students who are performing below grade level. Student math readiness is identified by diagnostic assessment and addressed with a corresponding sequence of games. SI provides instruction on math standards prerequisite to mastering middle school math and algebra. Scheduled ST Math time should be one to three times per week, with students spending no less than 30 to 40 minutes per session. While the form and structure of each school’s implementation of SI may vary based on the needs of its unique population, 100 percent completion of individual learning objectives (i.e. Proportional Reasoning) found in ST Math for SI is recommended in order to see maximum student gains. As with the K-5 software, teachers should proactively monitor student progress; integrate the ST Math visual games into their classroom instruction; and work with MIND staff to receive the training and support needed for successful implementation.ST Math Fluency helps students build fluency with addition and multiplication math facts, building speed and accuracy with understanding. The use of animated virtual manipulatives enables an intuitive process of learning that makes basic math fact recall effortless. This automaticity frees students’ working memory for problem solving. MIND’s unite visual approach ensures that students memorize their basic addition and multiplication facts while gaining a solid conceptual understanding of the operations. Fluency incorporates a continuous, built-in assessment to detect the need to accelerate a student past content in which they demonstrate fluency (while periodically prob8ing that content to ensure fluency is retained) or to identify if a student needs additional practice in a particular area. If additional practice is then needed, the software adapts to provide it. Students are automatically called to self-pace through timed fluency training and practice through an automated carousel system. Teachers receive online training, and are able to review progress and fluency mastery through online reports.Algebra Readiness is a full curriculum that rebuilds a solid math foundation for middle and high school students and prepares them for success in Algebra 1. The complete set of materials includes the Algebra Readiness software, teacher and student edition textbooks and additional instructional materials. The research-proven math software taps the brain’s innate ability to process information visually by capturing an image mentally and manipulating it over space and time; the innovative presentation and diagrams in the textbook explain and connect essential math concepts and skills covered in grades 2 through 7; and the warm-ups, assessments and additional teacher resource materials provide the requisite tools to successfully implement the program.Notable results  The innovative spatial visualization, blended-learning approach implemented through ST Math has shown substantial, important results in student math achievement across a wide variety of districts and various student populations. Currently reaching more than 1,200 schools, 13,000 teachers and 350,000 students across the country, the success of ST Math in improving student math proficiency has proven replicable and scalable. Some of many examples of results are as follows:1. Chicago Public Schools: Students, 84% of whom qualified for the federal free and reduced lunch program, using ST Math doubled their growth in math proficiency on state standardized math tests from 2010 to 2011 when compared to similar non-participating schools in the area.2. Los Angeles Unified School District: 9,600 students at 46 elementary schools serving 51% English Language Learners and 91% low-income students experienced a 13.6% gain in math proficiency from 2010 to 2011. This is compared with a 6.5% gain for similar non-participating schools.3. Houston: The number of top-scoring students at Houston Independent School District, with 88% Hispanic and African-American, 79% low-income, and 59% English Language Learner, increased scores 11.5% after implementing ST Math. This is compared to 4.2% at similar non-participating schools.4. Silicon Valley: ST Math students at 20 schools serving primarily low-income and minority students in Silicon Valley realized an 11.22% point increase in math proficiency, as compared to an increase of 4.8 points for a comparison group.5. Las Vegas: ST Math students at seven low-income schools experienced a gain in math proficiency of double that of non-ST Math students over the course of two years (2009 to 2011).ST Math is currently the subject of a four-year U.S. Department of Education Institute of Educational Sciences study. This randomized study is now up to 11,000 treatment and 10,000 control students, in grades 2 through 5, in California schools serving dominantly free/reduced-lunch program, Hispanic, English Language Learning students in Orange County, Calif. Two program efficacy papers have been released to-date, the first presented at the American Education Researchers Association (AERA) Conference in 2010 (Rutherford et.al., 2010), and the second at AERA in 2011 (Rutherford et.al., 2011). Both papers examined California Standards Test math outcomes and found significant effect sizes of around 0.3.On the horizon  Research-driven Development The web-based platform of ST Math allows MIND to collect student progress information, giving the organization deep insights into how children learn. The data, gathered from each click-stream of every student in the program, provides rich feedback on the learning process. MIND “mines” this data to continually enhance the ST Math approach. In addition, ongoing observational data from computer lab sessions helps assess stumbling blocks and teacher interaction. The collected feedback enables us to pinpoint areas for further teacher professional development, and guides us in the development of “classroom connection” lessons, through which teachers help children make connections between the ST Math software and traditional classroom instruction. Our blended-learning model is constantly adapting to the learning needs of students and teaching needs of educators in order to maximize the full benefit of the visually-based approach.Growth and Expansion In order to reach as many students as possible with its proven approach, MIND instituted a fee-for-service model in 2005, after relying primarily on charitable support, in order to ensure future sustainability of its programs. To achieve expansion goals, MIND conducts fundraising and marketing activities, attending education trade shows; conducting public relations specifically geared to education officials, principals and teachers; expanding our national and regional sales force; and soliciting charitable contributions to “seed” targeted geographic regions. Over the last five years, MIND has experienced an average growth rate of 30% in number of schools served.In 2008, MIND created another model to accelerate the adoption of its program. Forming a community collaboration with the Orange County Department of Education and local corporate and foundation partners, MIND launched the Math Initiative in Orange County, CA. The Initiative, a $4.8 million effort, targeted the 142 schools scoring in the lowest three deciles (out of 10 deciles) on California standardized math tests. As of today, MIND has raised over $3.5 million in the community to support the now 108 elementary and middle schools in Orange County participating in this effort. Based on the tremendous success in launching the initial effort in Orange County, MIND selected other urban areas across the country to replicate this model of elevating math performance among the lowest-performing schools. MIND has offered its award-winning math programs through Math Initiatives in Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, Dallas/Austin, Orlando, and New York City, reaching a total of nearly 150,000 students. The goal is to give these disadvantaged schools a powerful tool that has been proven to improve the educational outcomes, and thus career prospects, for the most at-risk students.In addition to expanding its current programs, MIND continues to develop additional curricula and technology applications of its approach. With a focus on robust interactive technology tools such as mobile platforms and interactive whiteboards, MIND is currently developing curricula for middle school grades. A preK program, currently being pilot tested, will be released in 2012 and provides a comprehensive, blended learning program for early childhood educators.Wish List MIND’s revenue model, which is comprised of program fees from our school partners and philanthropic donations, facilitates the sustainability and scalability of MIND’s work. As a nonprofit, MIND relies on charitable funding in order to conduct its research and development activities. Philanthropic partnerships provide the support, both financial and in-kind, to push MIND’s strategic agenda to accelerate the growth and extension of its programs in the vast education market. Current philanthropic partners include Cisco, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Wells Fargo, to name a few. Upcoming curriculum and technology development projects provide unique opportunities for potential partners to make a deep impact in education; with an investment in MIND, philanthropic partners will help revolutionize math instruction in the United States and make a lasting change in the lives of millions of children.

Through partnerships with local schools, students have an option to receive support from local, highly-qualified teachers and enjoy optional co-curricular and extracurricular activities.Program backgroundHistory and context  Authorized by state legislation, Pasco eSchool is a district-operated virtual instruction program. Offering a host of options to families with students in grades K-12, Pasco eSchool’s strength is its blended program which offers students an option to enroll in coursework with local, highly-qualified teachers. Through partnerships with local schools, Pasco eSchool has quickly risen to become the third largest franchise of the Florida Virtual School and provides high student success rates.Students taking Pasco eSchool courses may choose to work from home, from an on-campus lab (where space and schedules permit), and in optional face-to-face sessions with their virtual instructors. Pasco eSchool is supported by guidance counselors who provide personalized education planning, student progress monitoring, and coordination with local schools.Pasco eSchool offers access to curriculum from leading virtual programs, including: The Florida Virtual School Calvert Partners, Inc. Aventa Learning, Inc. K12.com Connections Academy … and more!Blended model  Under current guidelines, students may only participate in the virtual program if they meet eligibility criteria specified by state law. Virtual courses must be considered part of the student’s school day (not supplementary), and are bound by the district’s traditional school year calendar. Students are required to participate in state and local assessment programs, including FCAT, FAIR, and End of Course examinations.While many students participate in an online-driven model, meaning that their primary instruction is delivered online, others are able to work from on-campus labs facilitated by teachers in our physical schools. Students have access to their virtual teachers between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. throughout the week–and many instructors offer options for weekend availability. Virtual teachers are accessible via email, phone, instant messenger, text message, and webinar sessions. Many instructors also host face-to-face sessions throughout the county, and visit our on-campus virtual labs.Students complete a variety of online assignments and assessments, in addition to required discussion-based assessments and monthly calls with online instructors. Coursework requires collaboration with classmates, and offers students a variety of options for demonstrating mastery of course objectives.Notable results  In its short two-year history, Pasco eSchool has risen to become the third largest franchise of the Florida Virtual School. 100% of the students and parents were highly satisfied with their experience, as measured by exit surveys conducted at the end of the 2009-2010 school year. Because of its high completion rates, Pasco eSchool has shown local schools and the community that virtual instruction is a viable choice option to meet student and family needs. Pasco eSchool has also offered the school district an option to limit the financial impact of new virtual instruction initiatives because a high-quality, local program meets the needs of our stakeholders.On the horizon  The District School Board of Pasco County plans to expand its locally-operated program by adding two full-time elementary teachers. This will strengthen the connection between our K-5 students and local school programs while expanding local choice options. At the secondary level, Pasco eSchool is partnering with more vendors to expand its course catalog to meet student needs and interests.With a new high school graduation requirement of one online course phasing in for freshmen entering in 2011-2012, Pasco eSchool will continue to work with local schools to provide a variety of options to meet the needs of all learners. We will be helping to coordinate the implementation of computer-assisted credit-recovery programs alongside virtual learning labs to increase access and support for students.Our wish list includes: funding for technology hardware to provide parity a rigorous screening process to vet online courses and providers open access to district virtual programs state policies that permit a level playing field that allows all virtual programs operating in the state to operate year-round and receive funding in the same manner. Current policies are not equitable among district programs, FLVS, and blended charter school options.Submitted by JoAnne Glenn on May 21, 2011Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Reader-generated profilesLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Today, it has 300 employees servicing 30,000 virtual students each year. Primavera is fully accredited and has developed its own proprietary learning management system with 150 courses in its curriculum development department. Primavera currently has $30 Million in revenue annually and is growing the student body. In 2008, the percentage of students who were submitting attendance was 64.5%. As of 2011, that percentage has risen to 94.9%.The full-time student base in 2008 was 20% of the total student body. As of 2011, full-time students represent 80% of the total student body. Primavera has shifted as an organization that serviced credit recovery and concurrency to becoming a provider of full time high school education.Primavera has greatly improved student retention and is now offering 150 custom-designed courses. Primavera does not source out any component of their business model besides textbooks.Blended model  Primavera has taken the opposite approach that most schools have to blended learning. Primavera started out as a 100% virtual school, and is now moving toward in-class instruction combined with online learning. The blended-learning model is blended-learning centers with classrooms as well as a lab. This product is in addition to the core business, the all-virtual school.Scheduling is daily on weekdays, teachers will have a dual role: online instruction in a virtual capacity, as well as in-class teaching. Primavera is in the process of developing the blended-learning centers to add to the largest high school in Arizona, its all-virtual school.Notable results  Primavera has scaled its virtual school and as such is adding blended learning to its offerings.On the horizon  Primavera plans to scale blended-learning centers in the state of Arizona. The school has scaled its virtual high school and is now in the process of scaling both the virtual middle school as well as the blended- learning centers.In our wish list is developing a state-of-the-art learning management system that will be the LMS of the future. We have developed all of our own technology so the students have customized learning already. But the LMS of the future will determine how well the students can learn. We are looking to develop a system with immediate feedback and immediate learnings within our LMS.Submitted by Damian Creamer on July 6, 2011 Primavera Online High School, Founder Damian Creamer 2471 N Arizona Ave, Chandler, AZ 85225, damian.creamer@primaveratech.org, 480-307-1309Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Reader-generated profilesLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

These online courses can be completed by students at home or during a cyber period at school. Students work at their own pace to complete their online courses and adhere to minimum pacing guidelines as set by teaching staff. Attendance is valued by calculating a combination of login time, teacher communication, and work completion.Program backgroundHistory and context  Quakertown Community School District (QCSD) serves roughly 5,500 student grades K-12. The district began its blended-learning endeavor in 2008 with the hope of keeping high-risk students from dropping out of the system and offering more flexible course offering for students with outside of school commitments and those wishing to accelerate. The first iteration had 91 students, 33 of those students taking between 5-9 mostly core courses. The program was a combination of contracted courses and those taught by QCSD teachers. The program has since expanded its scope to offer all students the opportunity to take an online course and have control over the pace of their learning. Since 2009 the number of students enrolled in online courses has tripled. Now, roughly one-fourth of the district’s 2,966 students grade 6-12 are taking at least one class online. At this juncture, 60 classes 6-12 can be taken in an online format with 10 more to be added for the next school year. These courses reflect the QCSD “face to face” curriculum and are designed and taught by QCSD teaching staff, with the exception of Chinese and Japanese.Blended model  QCSD offers students in grades 6-12 the option of taking one or more supplemental online courses. Recognizing that independent online learning is not a good fit for all students, the district has developed an initial assessment that students take to determine if online classes will fit their learning style. All students complete a cyber orientation course prior to enrollment in academic cyber courses.Courses are asynchronous and students can work on them any time during the day. Many students take advantage of this option in order to work around vocational programs, work schedules, and extracurricular interests. Some students work on their online classes at home, whereas others work on them at school during cyber periods.QCSD has created designated areas in their middle and high schools for students to work on their online courses. These spaces are set up like comfortable cafes and are called “cyber lounges.”All online courses are taught by QCSD teachers, with the exception of a few subjects (like Mandarin) for which there is no certified teacher in the district. QCSD also employs one full-time mentor to ensure that students are consistently and actively participating in their online coursework. About half of all QCSD teachers teach at least one online course, and two district teachers teach only online courses. Because most QCSD online teachers are also teaching face-to-face classes in district schools, students who are blending online and face-to-face classes have the ability to access their online teachers in person. Many online teachers host online and in-person office hours during their prep and cyber periods.QCSD’s online courses allow students to move at their own pace and complete courses based on competency rather than being tethered to the traditional semester timeline.Notable results  During the 2010-11 school year, QCSD’s high school dropout rate decreased by 10 percent, thanks in part to the district’s ability to accommodate students who needed more flexibility in their schedules due to work or familial responsibilities. The district anticipates that the blended options will keep more students from leaving in the future.Some previously cyber charter students have reentered the district because of the availability of online courses. This offers a financial benefit to QCSD, which recouped $11,000 per re-enrolled student last year.In 2011 the district achieved its highest SAT, ACT, and state test scores to date. QCSD is careful not to directly attribute these results to the availability of online courses, but administrators feel that these options have certainly contributed to this increase.The district has successfully partnered with the local teachers union in this blended-learning effort. The local union president has taught online classes and is partially responsible for the district’s professional development surrounding online learning. The superintendent notes that having union leaders onboard with online learning in a tangible way is a great step forward for reform.In 2011 QCSD won the Innovator Award for Innovative Online Learning Practice from iNACOL, the International Association for K-12 Online Learning.On the horizon  QCSD hopes to continually expand and improve blended-learning options for its students, especially by devoting more time and resources to help improve teachers’ online teaching skills with ongoing professional development. Each year more and more courses are offered in a blended-learning format with 10 new courses being added for the 2012 -2013 school year.To increase accessibility, QCSD has successfully partnered with Best Buy to provide discounted laptop computers and with Comcast to provide low-cost high-speed internet to increase students’ access to online classes and resources at home. Additionally, one-to-one laptop and Bring Your Own Technology (BYOT) initiatives are being implemented in QCSD high schools to create almost seamless blended instruction.QCSD teachers are encouraged to integrate digital tools in every class, not just their online courses, in order to provide student access to course materials if they have to miss class for any reason. Teachers are also exploring the possibility of video recording critical classroom demonstrations to catalog for out of school access. With the hope that time and funds to devote to online options will increase, officials at QCSD plan to channel their strong desire for quality blended programs into many improvements and developments.Submitted by Lisa Andrejko on August 9, 2011Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Reader-generated profilesLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Students progress through the math curriculum at their own pace.Program backgroundHistory and context The STAR Prep Academy (STAR Prep) is a private middle and high school for students who seek an individualized approach to learning, based on their desired areas of specialization. Founded in Culver City, California in 2003, the school serves 40 students in grades 6-12. Its practical, interactive, and self-motivated structure nurtures analytical thinking, encourages exploration and discovery, and prepares students for college, career, and life-long success. STAR Prep is located within the internationally award-winning STAR ECO Station, an environmental science museum and exotic wildlife rescue center. STAR Prep students are exposed to a wide range of hands-on opportunities not afforded any other students in the Los Angeles area: environmental science classes, animal husbandry, international retreats, an exciting array of foreign language courses and more.In 2008, Paul Rotaru, a math teacher at STAR Prep noticed that his students were missing the same problems over and over again on their homework and were exhibiting negative attitudes toward math. Rotaru created a flex model in his classroom where students could work at their own pace via online courses and he could work as coach with the aid of computerized reports to help students avoid making the same mistakes repeatedly. This model has vastly improved both student attitude and student performance.Blended model  In math classes, students are provided with laptops with access only to math programs and strictly monitored. Each student has either an ALEKS account (lower grades) or access to webAssign and/or MakingMath (higher grades). Depending on their schedule, students are enrolled in one of the eight math periods independent of grade level. During the 50-minute class period, very little time is spent on lectures, and the teacher acts as coach and tutor. All students are at different levels and receive instruction accordingly. When students have questions about their online work, they raise their hand to receive individualized help. The teacher’s computer screen shows all the students’ working computer screens. When asked a question that is applicable to more than one student, the teacher can project images from his computer and explain the solution. Reading and watching video tutorials are assigned for homework, and problem solving using online programs fills all class time. Students work at their own pace. The teacher is aware, in real time, of which students are struggling with particular concepts. Students are responsible for their own work and take ownership of their education.This model works at STAR Prep due to the fact that one math instructor can teach all math levels. The teacher also encourages advanced math students to help the younger ones.Notable results The most notable result of implementing this blended model thus far has been an improvement in students’ attitudes toward learning math. Students are aware of the benefits of the blended-learning model and enjoy this individualized model.Additionally, standardized test scores have improved year to year;  some STAR Prep students have shown up to a 300 percent increase in one year. Strong students are progressing rapidly and some have mastered two or even three math courses in one year. There has been some resistance from parents, teachers, and students as this blended model has evolved, but the results are encouraging.On the horizon STAR Prep plans t0 implement more technology resources across subject departments, and future blended-learning programs are possible, using the school’s math program as a model.Submitted by Paul Rotaru on October 24, 2011Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Reader-generated profilesLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

At school they practice and apply their learning with a face-to-face teacher.Program backgroundHistory and context  Stillwater Area Public Schools (SAPS) is a suburban district that serves 18 towns along the St. Croix River in Minnesota. The district has 8,400 students in 10 elementary schools (grades K-6), two junior high schools (grades 7-9), one high school (grades 10-12), and one alternative learning center (grades 10-12).From September 2011 until January 2012, the district implemented a Flipped-Classroom pilot program with six 5th-grade math teachers from five different elementary schools. Students viewed teacher-created lecture videos after school and then completed practice problems in class with the help of their teachers (thus “flipping” the traditional model of lectures in school and practice problems at home). To prepare for the pilot, participating teachers completed a four-day summer training  to learn the basics of video production, techniques for effectively understanding student data, and strategies for restructuring class time. Teachers produced videos explaining concepts traditionally taught in class using ScreenFlow, a microphone, and a tablet. The videos were then posted in Moodle and to the district’s podcast feed server so that students could access them from their home computers, tablets, or smart phones. Technology integration specialists provided DVDs or iPod Touches with the videos preloaded to students who do not have Internet access at home.Parents, teachers, and students felt the pilot was a success and the decision was made to expand to the program to 26 classrooms in grades 4-6. As the program has grown, increased specialization and coordination amongst teachers has evolved. Grade-level teachers have made arrangements such that one teacher will make the videos, a different teacher will create the quizzes for understanding, another will refine additional learning materials, and yet another will assist in managing the Moodle pages. As of this writing there is at least one flipped classroom in each of the district’s 10 elementary schools. The district currently supports 26 teachers using the Flipped-Classroom model.Blended model Students are assigned lecture videos created by their teachers to watch most weeknights at home. After viewing the lecture (with the ability to pause or rewind at any time), students complete a short quiz online through Moodle to demonstrate their understanding. Students who did not have Internet access at home are able to complete the short quizzes the following day at school. Teachers use this daily data to inform their plans for class.When students enter the classroom, they are expected to have watched the video. If they have not, they are directed to an iPad or computer station to catch up. Teachers’ lesson plans vary according to style and student needs, but generally teachers spend anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes reviewing the concept in front of the whole class, depending on the students’ understanding as demonstrated on the quiz scores. After this quick review, students break out into groups to work on practice problems (what would be considered homework questions in a traditional classroom). Teachers circle the classroom to help students individually or in small groups. If a student completes her “homework” in-class before her peers and has demonstrated mastery of the concept(s), then she is free to move ahead at her own pace by watching the next lecture video in the series.Notable resultsDuring the pilot and continuing through the school year, teachers, parents and students have all expressed enthusiasm for the Flipped-Classroom model. Teachers estimate that they previously spent 45 to 50 minutes of a 75-minute block lecturing to students; now that students learn content prior to coming to class, teachers can spend the majority of class time working closely with students on conceptual understanding rather than lecturing. SAPS teachers report that they enjoy this restructuring of scheduling and feel that it improves student engagement and learning. Parents of students in flipped classrooms have expressed that they enjoy learning concepts along with their children and struggle much less with encouraging their children to complete their homework. Students have been continually excited about the “flip” as the program has expanded.The flipped classrooms have shown to be effective in accelerating student learning: eight weeks into the pilot program the flipped classrooms were already one to two weeks ahead of the district’s pacing schedule.The program has proved to be cost neutral.On the horizon This summer SAPS will begin a Flipped-Classroom model curriculum for one-third of its 4th-grade math classes, nearly all of its 5th-grade math classes, and about one-quarter of its 6th-grade math classes. The district hopes to also flip its 3rd-grade math classes in the future. The growth has been and will continue to be largely teacher-driven. District technology administrators anticipate that other elementary school subjects will begin to move toward the Flipped- Classroom model as early as next year as a result of teacher enthusiasm.Given that an entire year’s worth of videos are now available for 5th-grade math classes, the district plans to give incoming 5th graders access to the videos in the summer so that they can begin to prepare for the coming year. They also hope the videos will be useful for incoming 6th graders, allowing them to review familiar concepts before the new school year.Beginning in the 2012-2013 school year, the district will be partnering with the University of Minnesota to conduct a rigorous academic study of its Flipped-Classroom model.Share this articleFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggStumbleUponAdd to favoritesEmailRSS Filed under: Blended-Learning Profiles - Reader-generated profilesLeave a ReplyName (required)Mail (will not be published) (required)Website ",

Students attend class five days a week at the YCCS Learning Center at Malcolm X College. Their required hours of schooling include three hours of in-classroom instruction per day and two hours of independent, online instruction per day. Students can attend their face-to-face classes (which include various learning activities, online and otherwise) during one of three possible three-hour blocks during the day and work on their online courses either on campus or remotely.Program backgroundHistory and context  Youth Connection Charter School (YCCS) opened in 1997 and is the only charter school in the State of Illinois that offers academic choices to students who have dropped out of traditional high schools, but show desire for a better future. YCCS is a tuition-free, public school program of Chicago Public Schools, and a partnership between Youth Connection Charter School, Malcolm X College, and K12, Inc. To qualify for admission into YCCS Virtual High School, students must be between 18 and 21 with 12 or more credits already completed toward achieving their high school diploma.In addition to the blended-learning program, YCCS Virtual High School provides students with many support services, including career counseling, academic counseling, mentoring, social service referrals, tutoring, job referrals and internships, and Students in Transitional Living Situations (STLS) services. Also, students may use all or part of the additional two hour per day instruction requirement to participate in the YCCS Virtual High School Work Study Program. Students must be approved to participate in this program and may earn up to 0.5 credit per semester for a maximum of one full credit per academic year.Blended modelThe program is designed to give students the choices they need, such as flexibility in scheduling to allow for job and family responsibilities and a robust collection of course offerings to fulfill needed requirements. An individualized program is designed for each student by the YCCS Virtual High School team. Due to varying skill levels and credit needs, no two students have the same learning plan. Students attend class five days a week at the YCCS Virtual High School Learning Center at Malcolm X College. They spend three hours in the classroom per day and two hours working independently online per day. New students are required to take a foundations course to introduce them to YCCS’s values, policies, and mission and to acclimate them to the online-learning environment. Students work at their own pace through K12′s virtual courses, with the help of YCCS teachers. YCCS employs four core teachers, in addition to several paraprofessionals, to work in three classrooms with 25 students each. In the classroom, students work through their online courses while teachers work with them variably on assessments, small group instruction and practice, discussion and instruction, depending on students’ needs. Students can choose between three different blocks of time to attend their face-to-face classes. They complete their required two hours of independent work time either on or off campus. By demonstrating a perfect attendance record, students can earn their own laptop.YCCS Virtual High School offers K12, Inc.’s robust offerings of over 130 core and elective courses. K12, Inc.’s math, English, science, and history courses are offered in multiple versions to meet the needs of diverse learners with diverse goals. Up to four levels of five different world languages and multiple electives are offered as well.The pace of the program is flexible, but important benchmarks must be reached within a timely fashion including earning a minimum of 5 credits per year (or 2.5 credits per semester), completing the TABE pre- and post-test every year, and demonstrating at least one month of academic gains for each month enrolled in the program. Workshops, ongoing development, and face-to-face tutoring is available to students to assist in reaching these important benchmarks. YCCS’s “Learn to Earn” scholarship program offers financial incentives for excellent academic performance.A large part of YCCS’s program is providing students with non-academic support to help remove roadblocks that have prevented graduation. Therapy, mentoring, childcare and housing resources, and internships are made available, and an ongoing speaker series engages students in important conversations about improving their lives outside of school.Notable results  In its first year, the YCCS Virtual High School program saw immediate success with improved enrollment, retention, and graduation rates. Enrollment from first to second semester increased 250 percent, from 38 to 150 students, and the retention rate was high at 70 percent. Fifty percent of students graduated after their first semester at YCCS, and sixty students (92 percent of those eligible) graduated from the program in June 2010.On the horizonYCCS Virtual High School hopes to expand beyond Malcolm X College to other community colleges and eventually universities offering dual enrollment. They also plan to offer more robust co-op and work study programs in the future. One wish for technology improvement moving forward is an offering of virtual classes to teach non-academic, post-secondary life skills. YCCS hopes that policymakers will continue to provide for more flexibility to allow greater online and blended-learning opportunities.
